!SECTION	Compiling and Installing

Q:	Why can't I compile Pidgin?

A:	Make sure you have relatively recent versions of automake, autoconf,
and gettext.  HOWEVER, generally speaking, having the absolute newest of
them is not as good as having one version short of newest since we might
not have found work-arounds for the latest set of changes.  Also, some
versions of automake require certain ranges of gettext versions, and we are
utterly unable to keep track of what versions will work with what other
versions.
<p>
 If you have Slackware &lt; 9.1, you need to get non-slack packages for autoconf,
automake and libtool.  You also have to copy the contents of
 <code>/usr/local/share/aclocal</code> to <code>/usr/share/aclocal</code>.  This is due to bugs in
 Slackware and the auto* packages.
</p>
<p>
*BSD users may also have problems with libtool and will also have to remove
the <code>--no-verify</code> from the configure script.

!ANCHOR	crash-on-start
Q:	Why is Pidgin crashing when I start it?

A:	First of all make sure you are using the most recent version of
Pidgin. If you still have problems, try the following:
<ul>
 <li>
  Make sure only one version of Pidgin is installed.  "whereis pidgin"
  can sometimes be useful for determining this.
 </li>
 <li>
  "export GDK_USE_XFT=0" in a terminal and then run Pidgin from the same
  terminal.
 </li>
 <li>
  Try disabling or deleting any 3rd party plugins, especially anything
  related to encryption.
 </li>
 <li>If you use 0.75 or higher on win32, try deleting <code>tcl.dll</code>.</li>
</ul>

!ANCHOR mtn
Q:	Pidgin &lt;non-current version&gt; is buggy.  Pidgin MTN is buggy.  Why?

A:	Non-current versions have old bugs which may be fixed in the
current version--that's why we make new releases.  MTN is
frequently unusable because of changes in the code.  Bugs are
introduced during the development process and are hopefully fixed
before a release is made.


!SECTION	Using Pidgin

Q:	How do I use Google Talk?

A:	Create a Jabber account as per <a
href="http://www.google.com/support/talk/bin/answer.py?answer=24073">Google's
FAQ</a>.  The Audio component is not currently supported and will not be
until work on it is finished.  We have no time frame for that as yet.

Q:	Why do the emblems move around the status icon?

A:	The four corners of the icon have different precedence.  The lower-right
is the highest, lower-left is second-highest, etc.  The most important emblem
is in the lower-right, always.  When an AOL buddy is not away, the fact that
[s]he's an AOL user is the most important information shown in the icon.  The
consistency is that the user can always look in the same place on the icon to
find out what he needs to know.  Also, importantly, the lower-right corner
emblem is the only emblem that shows up when "Small list" is on, as only one
emblem would fit.

!SECTION	Features

Q:	Does Pidgin support animated smileys?

A:	Yes, but there is a bug which can cause animation to be lost if
Pidgin has to resize the image.

!SECTION	MSN Protocol

Q:	Will Pidgin support MSN video chat?

A:	See <a href="#vv">this question</a>.

Q:	Why can't I sign on to MSN?

A:	You probably did not compile Pidgin with SSL support, or the SSL
plugin failed to
load.  The MSN protocol requires the use of SSL,
which Pidgin provides by either GnuTLS or the combination of NSS and NSPR
from the Mozilla project.  Install one or both of these and recompile Pidgin,
and see the next question.

!SECTION	Gadu-Gadu Protocol

Q:	What is Gadu-Gadu?

A:	Gadu-Gadu is an IM protocol popular in Poland.  You can find more about
it at <a href="http://www.gadu-gadu.pl/">www.gadu-gadu.pl</a>
(website in Polish).

!ANCHOR	libgadu
Q:	I compiled Pidgin from source and now it doesn't have Gadu-Gadu
support. Why?

A:	We now use an external libgadu.  Install your distro's libgadu-dev
or libgadu-devel package and rebuild Pidgin (making sure to rerun
<code>./configure</code>).  If your distro doesn't provide libgadu, you can download it from
<a href="http://toxygen.net/libgadu/files/libgadu-1.7.0.tar.gz">http://toxygen.net/libgadu/files/libgadu-1.7.0.tar.gz</a>.
Unpack the tarball and run:
<pre><code>./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr --disable-libgadu-openssl --disable-static --enable-shared
make
su -c "make install"</code></pre>


!SECTION	Development

!ANCHOR	contribute
Q:	Can I help?

A:	Yes!  We especially need small patches for small bugs, and lots of
bug triaging.  There are a slew of a bug reports in Pidgin's bug report
tracker - you could pick one and try to tackle it and submit a patch.
We love patches.
<p>
Bug triaging is when you look at a bug report and determine whether it
is a duplicate of an earlier report, or whether it is user error, or
maybe you need to request additional information to be able to reproduce
the bug.  SourceForge won't let random users modify the settings on bugs,
but if you leave helpful comments we can go through and make the
appropriate changes.  <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=browse&group_id=235&atid=100235">Dig
in.</a>
</p>

Q:	Pidgin never leaves a core file.

A:	On most installs core files are limited in size to 0 bytes, and are
therefore not created.  To rectify this situation, add
<code>ulimit -c unlimited</code> to your startup scripts (<code>~/.bash_profile</code>
is a good place) or run it manually in a terminal before starting Pidgin
from that terminal.  You can also run Pidgin directly in gdb with
<code>gdb pidgin</code>.

!ANCHOR	vv
Q:	Will you support features such as voice chat, internet phones, or
video chat?

A:	We hope to add voice and video support in Pidgin 3.0.0.  We don't
have a timeline for when this will be finished.  Voice and video is
a very time intensive feature, and many of the core group of Pidgin
developers are very busy.  <a href="#contribute">Help ease their
burden!</a>

Q:	Where should I report bugs?

A:	<a href="./bug.php">Here</a>.

Q:	Where should I submit patches?

A:	<a href="./patches.php">Here</a>.

Q:	Did you guys reverse engineer it?

A:	Jabber, MSN and IRC are published protocols, so we
didn't have to reverse engineer those.  Oscar, ICQ, and Yahoo are not
published, and were reverse engineered by other people.  Novell was
provided by Novell, and SILC was written by one of the developers of
the protocol.


!SECTION	Miscellaneous Questions

Q:	Can I IM you guys?

A:	Sure! Look at the <a href="./contactinfo.php">Contact Information</a> page!

!ANCHOR	Hello
Q:	Hello?

A:	We don't know how to answer this question.  Stop asking it.

Q:	Does Pidgin support secure instant messaging (encrypted IMs)?

A:	Short answer: Yes, use the SILC protocol.<br/>
Long Answer (for other protocols): Not natively.  Doing secure instant messaging right is a big deal and
requires, among other things, an authentication scheme.  Simply encrypting
your data stream without verifying the party with whom you are chatting is
not secure in any way; some other clients offer options like this, but we
feel that such measures instill a false sense of security that is more
harmful than helpful.
<p>
 There are a number of 3rd party plugin developers
 working on developing a secure IM framework.  See the
 <a href="plugins.php">Plugins</a> page for links.
</p>

Q:	When will the next version of Pidgin be released?

A:	The schedule for releases is every third Thursday.  However, a new
version will only be released if it meets a certain standard of quality
(i.e., it will not be released if it still has a large number of serious
bugs).  Therefore, some releases will take longer than others.  Major
rewrites means lots of new bugs to work out.  The new version will be
released as soon as it is possible to do so.

!ANCHOR	version-number
Q:	What will the next version be?

A:	Starting with version 1.0.0, Pidgin version numbers have 3 parts to them.
The format is major.minor.micro.  If we change something internally in Pidgin
such that some plugins won't work with the newer version, we will increment
the major version number.  If we don't increment the major version number,
and we've added things to the Pidgin API that won't break any older stuff, we
will increment the minor version number.  In any other cases, we will
increment the micro version number.  Even and odd numbers have nothing to do
with stability, and you should always be running the latest release of Pidgin
to get new features and bug fixes.

Q:	So, can I look forward to mega-sexy super functionality with Pidgin?

A:	Yes, that is the intended idea.  In fact, there have been quite a number
of unpopular geeks who have made the switch to Pidgin.  In a matter of days,
the number of dates and awesomeness points received by the geek increased
ten fold!  You, too, can have an exciting life with Pidgin.  Get Pidgin.  Get
the babes.  Get uhh...  hmm.

Q:	How do I change the language for the Highlight Misspelled words option?

A:	Pidgin currently only supports spell checking in your locale language.
This is because gtkspell 2 does not offer a good way for us to know which
dictionaries are available or to switch between them.  This functionality has
long been promised for gtkspell version 3, which has been delayed somewhat
indefinitely.  See <a href="http://gtkspell.sf.net">gtkspell.sf.net</a>.
