!SECTION	Compiling and Installing

Q:	Why can't I compile Pidgin?

A:	Make sure you have relatively recent versions of automake, autoconf,
and gettext.  HOWEVER, generally speaking, having the absolute newest of
them is not as good as having one version short of newest since we might
not have found work-arounds for the latest set of changes.  Also, some
versions of automake require certain ranges of gettext versions, and we are
utterly unable to keep track of what versions will work with what other
versions.
<p>
 If you have Slackware &lt; 9.1, you need to get non-slack packages for autoconf,
automake and libtool.  You also have to copy the contents of
 <code>/usr/local/share/aclocal</code> to <code>/usr/share/aclocal</code>.  This is due to bugs in
 Slackware and the auto* packages.
</p>
<p>
*BSD users may also have problems with libtool and will also have to remove
the <code>--no-verify</code> from the configure script.

!SECTION	Using Pidgin

Q:	How do I use Google Talk?

A:	Create a Jabber account as per <a
href="http://www.google.com/support/talk/bin/answer.py?answer=24073">Google's
FAQ</a>.  The Audio component is not currently supported and will not be
until work on it is finished.  We have no time frame for that as yet.

Q:	Why do the emblems move around the status icon?

A:	The four corners of the icon have different precedence.  The lower-right
is the highest, lower-left is second-highest, etc.  The most important emblem
is in the lower-right, always.  When an AOL buddy is not away, the fact that
[s]he's an AOL user is the most important information shown in the icon.  The
consistency is that the user can always look in the same place on the icon to
find out what he needs to know.  Also, importantly, the lower-right corner
emblem is the only emblem that shows up when "Small list" is on, as only one
emblem would fit.

!SECTION	Features

Q:	Does Pidgin support animated smileys?

A:	Yes, but there is a bug which can cause animation to be lost if
Pidgin has to resize the image.

!SECTION	MSN Protocol

Q:	Will Pidgin support MSN video chat?

A:	See <a href="#vv">this question</a>.

Q:	Why can't I sign on to MSN?

A:	You probably did not compile Pidgin with SSL support, or the SSL
plugin failed to
load.  The MSN protocol requires the use of SSL,
which Pidgin provides by either GnuTLS or the combination of NSS and NSPR
from the Mozilla project.  Install one or both of these and recompile Pidgin,
and see the next question.


!SECTION	Development

Q:	Pidgin never leaves a core file.

A:	On most installs core files are limited in size to 0 bytes, and are
therefore not created.  To rectify this situation, add
<code>ulimit -c unlimited</code> to your startup scripts (<code>~/.bash_profile</code>
is a good place) or run it manually in a terminal before starting Pidgin
from that terminal.  You can also run Pidgin directly in gdb with
<code>gdb pidgin</code>.

!ANCHOR	vv
Q:	Will you support features such as voice chat, internet phones, or
video chat?

A:	We hope to add voice and video support in Pidgin 3.0.0.  We don't
have a timeline for when this will be finished.  Voice and video is
a very time intensive feature, and many of the core group of Pidgin
developers are very busy.  <a href="#contribute">Help ease their
burden!</a>

Q:	Where should I report bugs?

A:	<a href="./bug.php">Here</a>.

Q:	Where should I submit patches?

A:	<a href="./patches.php">Here</a>.

Q:	Did you guys reverse engineer it?

A:	Jabber, MSN and IRC are published protocols, so we
didn't have to reverse engineer those.  Oscar, ICQ, and Yahoo are not
published, and were reverse engineered by other people.  Novell was
provided by Novell, and SILC was written by one of the developers of
the protocol.


!SECTION	Miscellaneous Questions

Q:	Can I IM you guys?

A:	Sure! Look at the <a href="./contactinfo.php">Contact Information</a> page!

Q:	Does Pidgin support secure instant messaging (encrypted IMs)?

A:	Short answer: Yes, use the SILC protocol.<br/>
Long Answer (for other protocols): Not natively.  Doing secure instant messaging right is a big deal and
requires, among other things, an authentication scheme.  Simply encrypting
your data stream without verifying the party with whom you are chatting is
not secure in any way; some other clients offer options like this, but we
feel that such measures instill a false sense of security that is more
harmful than helpful.
<p>
 There are a number of 3rd party plugin developers
 working on developing a secure IM framework.  See the
 <a href="plugins.php">Plugins</a> page for links.

Q:	When will the next version of Pidgin be released?

A:	The schedule for releases is every third Thursday.  However, a new
version will only be released if it meets a certain standard of quality
(i.e., it will not be released if it still has a large number of serious
bugs).  Therefore, some releases will take longer than others.  Major
rewrites means lots of new bugs to work out.  The new version will be
released as soon as it is possible to do so.

Q:	How do I change the language for the Highlight Misspelled words option?

A:	Pidgin currently only supports spell checking in your locale language.
This is because gtkspell 2 does not offer a good way for us to know which
dictionaries are available or to switch between them.  This functionality has
long been promised for gtkspell version 3, which has been delayed somewhat
indefinitely.  See <a href="http://gtkspell.sf.net">gtkspell.sf.net</a>.
