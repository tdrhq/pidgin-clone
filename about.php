<h1>What Is Pidgin?</h1>
<p>
 Pidgin is an instant messaging program for Windows, Linux, BSD,

 <acronym title="AOL (R) Instant Messenger (TM)">AIM</acronym>,
 ICQ, Jabber/<acronym title="eXtensible Messaging and Presence
 Protocol">XMPP</acronym>, MSN Messenger, Yahoo!, Bonjour, Gadu-Gadu,
 <acronym title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</acronym>, Novell GroupWise
 Messenger, QQ, Lotus Sametime,
 <acronym title="Secure Internet Live Conferencing">SILC</acronym>,
 <acronym title="SIP for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging
 Extensions">SIMPLE</acronym>, and Zephyr.
</p>
<p>
 Pidgin can log in to multiple accounts on multiple IM networks
 simultaneously. This means that you can be chatting with friends on AIM,
 talking to a friend on Yahoo Messenger, and sitting in
 an IRC channel all at the same time.
</p>
<p>
 Pidgin supports many features of the various networks, such as file transfer,
 away messages, and typing notification.
 It also goes beyond that and provides many unique features.
 A few popular features are Buddy Pounces, which give the ability to notify
 you, send a message, play a sound, or run a program when a specific buddy
 goes away, signs online, or returns from idle; and plugins, consisting of
 text replacement, a buddy ticker, extended message notification, iconify
 on away, spell checking, tabbed conversations, and more.
</p>
<p>
 Pidgin runs on a number of platforms, including Windows, Linux, and
 <a href="http://qpe-gaim.sourceforge.net/">Qtopia</a> (Sharp Zaurus and
 iPaq).  Looking for Pidgin for OS-X?  Try

</p>
<p>
 Pidgin integrates well with GNOME 2 and KDE 3.1's system tray, as well as
 Windows's own system tray. This allows you to work with Pidgin without
 requiring the buddy list window to be open at all times.
</p>
<p>
 Pidgin is under constant development, and releases are usually frequent.
