--- STUFF FOR 0.11.0 RELEASE ---

THE CORE:
	Status labels in buddy list (mostly just for yahoo/msn)
	Border for GtkIMHtml
	Transparency for GtkIMHtml
	GPG Encryption of messages
	Better way of showing away state - and possibly in main window
	Implement:
		OPT_PROTO_NO_PASSWORD (mainly for IRC/Zephyr) - should hide password
			dialog in account editor
		OPT_PROTO_OFFLINE to allow sending offline messages... checkbox on
			the convo window? need to decide UI for switching between
			offline/ normal message. uh... maybe this isn't the best
			idea, but we need something that gives us this functionality....
			prpl->send_im_offline?
		OPT_PROTO_CHAT_TOPIC (for IRC/Jabber chatroom topics)
		OPT_PROTO_MAILCHECK (mainly for Yahoo/MSN) - with appropriate toggle
			on account editor modify thing for whether or not to display
			it (and also move Yahoo/MSN dialog to prpl.c and have both of
			them use it (is this doable? Yahoo only gives message count,
			what does MSN give?))
	Ha. Maybe we should also add OPT_GEN_MAILCHECK to check $MAIL (or
		/var/spool/mail/$USER if that fails). If we did that I could get rid
		of one more applet on my gnome panel and make it almost completely
		for the sole purpose of gaim_applet. (Maybe this could be a plugin?
		What should the UI be for this?)
	Away needs to be modified to include "show" and "status", i.e. you can have
		an away state, and an away message. This is exactly what ICQ does -
		you're "N/A" (show in Jabber) and your away message is "I'm gone."
		(status in Jabber). Since it only applies to ICQ and Jabber (and
		actually, currently only Jabber, since icqlib doesn't handle away
		messages yet), there should be some way of indicating that it can
		do both without breaking the others. My suggestion is to put "/" at
		the end of the "state", and when that's there, have it be a menu with
		all of the custom messages, e.g. in Jabber it'd return "Away/" as one
		of the states, and you'd see "Away" with a menu of all the away
		messages you have.

	Syd is cool and gave all of these ideas:
		Have multiple tickers in the same window, one for buddies
			like it is now, one for who just came online/offline
			(scrolled faster possibly because that doesn't
			happen very often), etc.
		Have tooltips on the passing buddies on the ticker
		Have a stock ticker (a plugin could easily make use of
			GtkTicker)

	Other RVOUS Actions

Yahoo:
	Chat
	File Transfer
	Offline Messaging

ICQ:
	Authorization (is requesting Auth necessary?)
	Chat
	File Transfer
	New User Registration
	Offline Messaging

MSN:
	Chat (?)

IRC:
	Actions (e.g. /op)
	File transfer?  Maybe later?

Jabber:
	Jabber Transports (having them show up on the buddy list should be
		fairly easy; having an appropriate right-click menu for
		them should also be somewhat easy. Providing a UI for adding
		transports should be rather difficult.)
	New Chat Method (?)
	Rework how subscriptions are handled

Napster:
	File Transfer
	New User Registration

Zephyr:
	God help us.

Future Plugins? :
	ICQ through Oscar plugin (ICQ2000) (requires hacking libfaim :-/)
		this would allow us to send SMS messages.
	Hotline (Or is this a waste of time?.  Ill decide soon enough, heh)


Then, of course, are all the Bugs that need to be fixed
	http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=100235&group_id=235&func=broswe
and the Feature Requests. SourceForge should really allow users
to vote on feature requests and bugs.....
