--- STUFF FOR 0.10.1 RELEASE ---
	Third sound option for people without soundcards who still want
		sound events.  Make a PC Speaker Beep (^G / Char 7)
	Save Buddy Chats
	Execute Command on Buddy Pounce
	Redesign the Foreground/Background color options under preferences.
	Add ability to conersaton window to allow changing of foreground/
		background colours per conversation window. 
	Have a page in the prefs for the Applet
	Redesign the Away Messages page in the prefs
	Somehow make it so plugins can communicate

	Syd is cool and gave all of these ideas:
		Have multiple tickers in the same window, one for buddies
			like it is now, one for who just came online/offline
			(scrolled faster possibly because that doesn't
			happen very often), etc.
		Have tooltips on the passing buddies on the ticker
		Have a stock ticker (a plugin could easily make use of
			GtkTicker)
		Have Alt access the menu in the buddy list, and ctl-char
			access items in those menus


	Possibly make it so that you can create ICQ-style 'aliases' for
		buddies on your buddy list.  This won't be too hard it'll
		just take a bit of work.  Maybe we'll save this one for the
		release after our next release.
	Maybe someday in the future gaim will be able to support multiple
		connections, so you can log on as 2+ names at once. Maybe.
