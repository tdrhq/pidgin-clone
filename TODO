--- STUFF FOR 0.11.0 RELEASE ---

THE CORE:
	Status labels in buddy list (mostly just for yahoo/msn)
	Border for GtkIMHtml
	GPG Encryption of messages
	Better way of showing away state - and possibly in main window
	OPT_PROTO_PASSWORD (mainly for IRC/Zephyr) - should hide password dialog
		in account editor
	Remove OPT_USR_KEEPALIVE (or whatever it's called) - keepalives shouldn't
		be optional
	OPT_PROTO_MAILCHECK (mainly for Yahoo/MSN) - with appropriate toggle on
		account editor modify thing for whether or not to display it (and
		also move Yahoo/MSN dialog to prpl.c and have both of them use it)
	Ha. Maybe we should also add OPT_GEN_MAILCHECK to check $MAIL (or
		/var/spool/mail/$USER if that fails). If we did that I could get rid
		of one more applet on my gnome panel and make it almost completely
		for the sole purpose of gaim_applet.
	OPT_PROTO_OFFLINE to allow sending offline messages... checkbox on the
		convo window? need to decide UI for switching between offline/
		normal message. uh... maybe this isn't the best idea, but we need
		something that gives us this functionality....
		prpl->send_im_offline?

	Syd is cool and gave all of these ideas:
		Have multiple tickers in the same window, one for buddies
			like it is now, one for who just came online/offline
			(scrolled faster possibly because that doesn't
			happen very often), etc.
		Have tooltips on the passing buddies on the ticker
		Have a stock ticker (a plugin could easily make use of
			GtkTicker)
