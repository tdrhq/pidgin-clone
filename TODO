--- STUFF FOR 0.11.1 RELEASE ---

	Execute Command on Buddy Pounce
	The about window is very ugly.  I think this shall be fixed.  
		You know, I really like the gnome look to some apps
		but I dont want to tie gnome into gaim.  oh life sucks
		sometimes hehe.

	Syd is cool and gave all of these ideas:
		Have multiple tickers in the same window, one for buddies
			like it is now, one for who just came online/offline
			(scrolled faster possibly because that doesn't
			happen very often), etc.
		Have tooltips on the passing buddies on the ticker
		Have a stock ticker (a plugin could easily make use of
			GtkTicker)
		Have Alt access the menu in the buddy list, and ctl-char
			access items in those menus
