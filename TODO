--- STUFF FOR 0.10.1 RELEASE ---
	Ability to merge gaim, toc, aim2, aim4 buddylists
	Third sound option for people without soundcards who still want
		sound events.  Make a PC Speaker Beep (^G / Char 7)
	Save Buddy Pounces 
	Save Buddy Chats
	Execute Command on Buddy Pounce
	Possibly make it so that you can create 'aliases' for buddies
		on your buddy list.  This won't be too hard it'll just
		take a bit of work.  Maybe we'll save this one for the
		release after our next release.
