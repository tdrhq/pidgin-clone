	Syd is cool and gave all of these ideas:
		Have multiple tickers in the same window, one for buddies
			like it is now, one for who just came online/offline
			(scrolled faster possibly because that doesn't
			happen very often), etc.
		Have tooltips on the passing buddies on the ticker
		Have a stock ticker (a plugin could easily make use of
			GtkTicker)
		Have Alt access the menu in the buddy list, and ctl-char
			access items in those menus
