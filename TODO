--- STUFF FOR 0.11.0 RELEASE ---

	File transfer for IRC?  Maybe later?
	Chat for Yahoo/ICQ
	File transfer for Yahoo/ICQ/Oscar/Napster
	Other RVOUS actions for TOC/Oscar
	Jabber Transports
	Fix MSN signon process
	Jabber/ICQ/Napster user registration

	Oscar blocking
	Rename for groups/buddies
	Status labels in buddy list (mostly just for yahoo)
	Border for GtkIMHtml

	I have an updated copy of libfaim. It adds a few new features
		(change password, confirm, req. email, change email,
		search by email). Unfortunately it breaks direct im.
		Once direct im is fixed (which should also cause get
		file to work) I'll add all these things to gaim.

	ICQ through Oscar plugin (requires hacking libfaim :-/)

	Syd is cool and gave all of these ideas:
		Have multiple tickers in the same window, one for buddies
			like it is now, one for who just came online/offline
			(scrolled faster possibly because that doesn't
			happen very often), etc.
		Have tooltips on the passing buddies on the ticker
		Have a stock ticker (a plugin could easily make use of
			GtkTicker)
		Have Alt access the menu in the buddy list, and ctl-char
			access items in those menus
