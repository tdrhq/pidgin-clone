--- STUFF FOR 0.11.0 RELEASE ---

	Other RVOUS actions for TOC/Oscar
	File transfer for IRC?  Maybe later?
	Jabber Transports
	ICQ/Napster user registration

	Rename for groups/buddies
	Status labels in buddy list (mostly just for yahoo)
	Border for GtkIMHtml
	Sounds on buddy pounce
	GPG Encryption of messages

	ICQ through Oscar plugin (requires hacking libfaim :-/)
	Zephyr
	Hotline (Or is this a waste of time?.  Ill decide soon enough, heh)

	Syd is cool and gave all of these ideas:
		Have multiple tickers in the same window, one for buddies
			like it is now, one for who just came online/offline
			(scrolled faster possibly because that doesn't
			happen very often), etc.
		Have tooltips on the passing buddies on the ticker
		Have a stock ticker (a plugin could easily make use of
			GtkTicker)


	Then, of course, are all the Bugs that need to be fixed
		http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=100235&group_id=235&func=broswe
	and the Feature Requests. SourceForge should really allow users
	to vote on feature requests and bugs.....
