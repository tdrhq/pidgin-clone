THE CORE:
	Status labels in buddy list (mostly just for yahoo/msn)
	Transparency for GtkIMHtml
	GPG Encryption of messages
	Better way of showing away state - and possibly in main window
	Moving GTK/GDK and related things out of the prpls
		TOC: file transfer (move into the core)
	Away needs to be modified to include "show" and "status", i.e. you can have
		an away state, and an away message. This is exactly what ICQ does -
		you're "N/A" (show in Jabber) and your away message is "I'm gone."
		(status in Jabber). Since it only applies to ICQ and Jabber (and
		actually, currently only Jabber, since icqlib doesn't handle away
		messages yet), there should be some way of indicating that it can
		do both without breaking the others. My suggestion is to put "/" at
		the end of the "state", and when that's there, have it be a menu with
		all of the custom messages, e.g. in Jabber it'd return "Away/" as one
		of the states, and you'd see "Away" with a menu of all the away
		messages you have.
	IRC has /list, Jabber has jabber:iq:browse, AIM has what's currently in the
		"Chat Rooms" options. We should have a way (besides the prefs window)
		of showing all the rooms available for each account/protocol (what's a
		good way to do this? IRC it varies based on who you're connected as,
		Jabber you need a connection to retrieve the list, and AIM you can get
		it while you're offline.)

	Syd is cool and gave all of these ideas:
		Have multiple tickers in the same window, one for buddies
			like it is now, one for who just came online/offline
			(scrolled faster possibly because that doesn't
			happen very often), etc.
		Have tooltips on the passing buddies on the ticker
		Have a stock ticker (a plugin could easily make use of
			GtkTicker)

Jabber:
	Jabber Transports (having them show up on the buddy list should be
		fairly easy; having an appropriate right-click menu for
		them should also be somewhat easy. Providing a UI for adding
		transports should be rather difficult.)

Future Plugins? :
	ICQ through Oscar plugin (ICQ2000) (requires hacking libfaim :-/)
		this would allow us to send SMS messages.
	Hotline (Or is this a waste of time?.  Ill decide soon enough, heh)


Then, of course, are all the Bugs that need to be fixed
	http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=100235&group_id=235&func=broswe
and the Feature Requests. SourceForge should really allow users
to vote on feature requests and bugs.....
