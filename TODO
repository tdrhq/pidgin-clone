--- STUFF FOR 0.11.0 RELEASE ---

THE CORE:
	Rename for groups/buddies (in the Edit Buddies Pane)
	Status labels in buddy list (mostly just for yahoo)
	Border for GtkIMHtml
	GPG Encryption of messages
	Better way of showing away state - and possibly in main window

	Syd is cool and gave all of these ideas:
		Have multiple tickers in the same window, one for buddies
			like it is now, one for who just came online/offline
			(scrolled faster possibly because that doesn't
			happen very often), etc.
		Have tooltips on the passing buddies on the ticker
		Have a stock ticker (a plugin could easily make use of
			GtkTicker)
