THE CORE:
	GPG Encryption of messages
	Have plugin_event use varargs instead of void*
	Separate core functions from UI stuff.
		about.c, applet.[ch], away.c, conversation.c, convo.h, multi.c,
		gtk*, prefs.c, prpl.c, sound.c, ticker.c
			little to no work (mostly GTK)

		gaimrc.c, html.c, proxy.[ch], prpl.h, server.c, util.c
			little to no work (mostly CORE)

		aim.c - need to redo main() completely
			- current main should be moved mostly to core
			- GTK main should connect to core
		browser.c - let the UI deal with this? little to no work.
		buddy.c - need to split into buddy.c and list.c
			- buddy.c handles add/remove/rename/alias buddies
			- list.c handles drawing the buddy list for GTK
		buddy_chat.c - need to move out non-GTK functions. some work.
		dialogs.c - need to move import/export out of here and into buddy.c
		gaim.h - need to separate into core.h and ui.h.
		idle.c - Need to figure out how to report idle times when there's
			more than one UI
		multi.h - need to separate GTK out of gaim_connection
		perl.c - Uh. Might need to do some splitting.
		plugins.c - Split the selection dialog with the loading/unloading
			- Need to figure out how plugins are going to interact
			  with UIs, though UIs are separate programs.
	Need to create struct buddy_chat, move struct conversation's in_room and
		ignored there, and copy id and name.
	Need to write the core side of the core-ui protocol
	Need to add in core.c to deal with sockets, etc. (Already written)

THE PROTOCOLS:

TOC:
	Other RVOUS Actions

Oscar:
	File Transfer
	Other RVOUS Actions

Yahoo:
	Chat
	File Transfer

ICQ:
	Chat
	File Transfer
	New User Registration

MSN:
	Need to make it so txqueue is a GSList* of char* instead of char*, so
		that you can "send" more than one message before you're
		actually connected. This is actually a bug that it doesn't do
		this already.
	Need some way of indicating "invite" in IM window
	File Transfer

IRC:
	/whois, /ban, /kickban, /list, /names
	DCC
	CTCP

Jabber:
	Jabber Transports (having them show up on the buddy list should be
		fairly easy; having an appropriate right-click menu for
		them should also be somewhat easy. Providing a UI for adding
		transports should be rather difficult.)
	Rework how subscriptions are handled
	Browsing
	New User Registration

Napster:
	File Transfer
	New User Registration

Zephyr:
	God help us.

Future Plugins? :
	ICQ through Oscar plugin (ICQ2000) (requires hacking libfaim :-/)
		this would allow us to send SMS messages.
	Hotline (Or is this a waste of time?.  Ill decide soon enough, heh)

----
THE UIS:

GTK:
	Transparency for GtkIMHtml
	Rewrite the HTML parser in GtkIMHtml
	Moving GTK/GDK and related things out of the prpls
		TOC: file transfer (move into the core)
	Status labels in buddy list (mostly just for yahoo/msn)
	Better way of showing away state - and possibly in main window
	Away needs to be modified to include "show" and "status", i.e. you can have
		an away state, and an away message. This is exactly what ICQ does -
		you're "N/A" (show in Jabber) and your away message is "I'm gone."
		(status in Jabber). Since it only applies to ICQ and Jabber (and
		actually, currently only Jabber, since icqlib doesn't handle away
		messages yet), there should be some way of indicating that it can
		do both without breaking the others. My suggestion is to put "/" at
		the end of the "state", and when that's there, have it be a menu with
		all of the custom messages, e.g. in Jabber it'd return "Away/" as one
		of the states, and you'd see "Away" with a menu of all the away
		messages you have.

	Syd is cool and gave all of these ideas:
		Have multiple tickers in the same window, one for buddies
			like it is now, one for who just came online/offline
			(scrolled faster possibly because that doesn't
			happen very often), etc.
		Have tooltips on the passing buddies on the ticker
		Have a stock ticker (a plugin could easily make use of
			GtkTicker)

and the Feature Requests. SourceForge should really allow users
