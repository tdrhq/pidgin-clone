--- STUFF FOR 0.10.1 RELEASE ---
	Ability to merge gaim, toc, aim2, aim4 buddylists
	Add "Group Add" button
	Third sound option for people without soundcards who still want
		sound events.  Make a PC Speaker Beep (^G / Char 7)
	I guess we'll stick those legend icons back in the info 
		window.  I forget why we took them out now.  I think
		it was because we were going to add minimal IMG tag
		support to gtkhtml and never did.
	Save Buddy Pounces (how did I forget this) 		
	Save Buddy Chats
