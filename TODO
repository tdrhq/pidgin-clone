--- STUFF FOR 0.10.1 RELEASE ---
	Third sound option for people without soundcards who still want
		sound events.  Make a PC Speaker Beep (^G / Char 7)
	Save Buddy Chats
	Execute Command on Buddy Pounce
	Redesign the Foreground/Background color options under preferences.
	Add ability to conersaton window to allow changing of foreground/
		background colours per conversation window. 
	Have a page in the prefs for the Applet
	Redesign the Away Messages page in the prefs
	Somehow make it so plugins can communicate
	The about window is very ugly.  I think this shall be fixed.  
		You know, I really like the gnome look to some apps
		but I dont want to tie gnome into gaim.  oh life sucks
		sometimes hehe.
	A TiK Compatiblity Fix:  Make GAIM (optional) Ignore anything that
		begins with: >>> Automated Message:
	---------
		Rob says:
		Also, we can make a TiK Compatiblity option (when using TOC)
		to send: >>>Automated Message: Getting Away Message<<
		This will take the away message thats sent back from the
		responding client and display it.

			Eric replies:
			I think the above is a bad idea and should not be
			implemented. If people want to get away messages,
			they should send their own message rather than
			an automated message. Ignoring TiK's automated
			message is a good idea though.
			
			Gaim and TiK are the most popular (are they?) Unix
			clients, but the number of winaim users still greatly
			outnumbers us. winaim won't be ignoring the automated
			message. IMHO, sending an automated message makes the
			client look weak and incapable.
	---------
		Not sure how we want
		to implement this but since TiK and GAIM are two of the
		most popular, I figured we might as well make them compatible.
	
		
	Oscar can send messages longer than TOC, and DirectIM has no limit.

	Syd is cool and gave all of these ideas:
		Have multiple tickers in the same window, one for buddies
			like it is now, one for who just came online/offline
			(scrolled faster possibly because that doesn't
			happen very often), etc.
		Have tooltips on the passing buddies on the ticker
		Have a stock ticker (a plugin could easily make use of
			GtkTicker)
		Have Alt access the menu in the buddy list, and ctl-char
			access items in those menus


	Maybe someday in the future gaim will be able to support multiple
		connections, so you can log on as 2+ names at once. Maybe.
