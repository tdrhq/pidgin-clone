--- STUFF FOR 0.11.0 RELEASE ---

THE CORE:
	Rename for groups/buddies (in the Edit Buddies Pane)
	Status labels in buddy list (mostly just for yahoo)
	Border for GtkIMHtml
	Sounds on buddy pounce
	GPG Encryption of messages
	Better way of showing away state - and possibly in main window

	Syd is cool and gave all of these ideas:
		Have multiple tickers in the same window, one for buddies
			like it is now, one for who just came online/offline
			(scrolled faster possibly because that doesn't
			happen very often), etc.
		Have tooltips on the passing buddies on the ticker
		Have a stock ticker (a plugin could easily make use of
			GtkTicker)

Then, of course, are all the Bugs that need to be fixed

and the Feature Requests. SourceForge should really allow users
to vote on feature requests and bugs.....

----------
	This is how buddy lists should work. This needs to be added to struct
	prpl:
		char *(*normalize)(char *)
	This is mostly for Jabber/MSN. E.g. for Jabber, passing "warmenhoven"
	gets you "warmenhoven@jabber.org", passing "warmenhoven@jabber.org/GAIM"
	gets you "warmenhoven@jabber.org". For AIM, "EWarmenhoven" returns
	"ewarmenhoven" and "Rob Flynn" returns "robflynn" (i.e. the names are
	normalized). Then finding buddies (in your buddy list and such) should
	work based off of that. Adding buddies similarly, you get the real name
	before you complete the adding process. Returning NULL will be for an
	invalid name (such as a non-numeric name in ICQ).  It will also be handy
	in IRC for removing the @ and + from the front of ops and those with +V
	status.
