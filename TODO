--- STUFF FOR 0.11.0 RELEASE ---

	Actions (e.g. /op) for IRC
	Chat for Yahoo/ICQ/MSN(??)
	File transfer for Yahoo/ICQ/Oscar/Napster
	Other RVOUS actions for TOC/Oscar
	File transfer for IRC?  Maybe later?
	Jabber Transports
	ICQ/Napster user registration

	Rename for groups/buddies
	Status labels in buddy list (mostly just for yahoo)
	Border for GtkIMHtml
	Sounds on buddy pounce
	GPG Encryption of messages

	ICQ through Oscar plugin (requires hacking libfaim :-/)
	Zephyr
	Hotline (Or is this a waste of time?.  Ill decide soon enough, heh)

	Syd is cool and gave all of these ideas:
		Have multiple tickers in the same window, one for buddies
			like it is now, one for who just came online/offline
			(scrolled faster possibly because that doesn't
			happen very often), etc.
		Have tooltips on the passing buddies on the ticker
		Have a stock ticker (a plugin could easily make use of
			GtkTicker)


	Then, of course, are all the Bugs that need to be fixed
		http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=100235&group_id=235&func=broswe
	and the Feature Requests. SourceForge should really allow users
	to vote on feature requests and bugs.....
		http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=350235&group_id=235&func=browse

	Oh yeah, then there's the little issue of getting Oscar working again.



	This is how buddy lists should work. This needs to be added to struct
	prpl:
		char *(*get_real_name)(char *)
	This is mostly for Jabber/MSN. E.g. for Jabber, passing "warmenhoven"
	gets you "warmenhoven@jabber.org", passing "warmenhoven@jabber.org/GAIM"
	gets you "warmenhoven@jabber.org". For AIM, "EWarmenhoven" returns
	"ewarmenhoven" and "Rob Flynn" returns "robflynn" (i.e. the names are
	normalized). Then finding buddies (in your buddy list and such) should
	work based off of that. Adding buddies similarly, you get the real name
	before you complete the adding process. Returning NULL will be for an
	invalid name (such as a non-numeric name in ICQ).
