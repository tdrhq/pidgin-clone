00:03:43 Flyn Orange: *shoots you with silly string*
00:03:55 RobFlynn: HELP! I AM COVERED IN NEONG REEN STRING
00:06:54 Flyn Orange: NEONG REEN, Taiwan (AP) -
                      Despite the recent economical collapses suffered due to 
                      massive geological activity over the last month, the very
                      profitable gag-manufacturer of Silly String has 
                      maintained production through the turmoil. Still 
                      employing 324 workers and a management team of 15 
                      Slinkies, there is no risk of a price hike in cans of
                      Silly String over the next few months...

14:45:15 RobFlynn: heheh

Eric and I were a little weird this night hehe


03:31:43 RobFlynn: "No Bite", she rebuked.
03:31:46 RobFlynn: Rebuked is a fun word.
03:31:51 RobFlynn: I don't know if I used it properly, but it is still fun.
03:31:55 Eric Warmenhoven: i like idiosyncratic
03:32:01 RobFlynn: I like sesquipedalian
03:32:14 Eric Warmenhoven: variations on idiosyncracy are my favorite words.
03:32:20 Eric Warmenhoven: i like them.
03:32:22 RobFlynn: I like sesquipedalian because it is polysylabic by
defination and practice.
03:32:25 Eric Warmenhoven: that's one of my idiosyncracies.
03:32:40 RobFlynn: Idiosyncracy is a sesquipedalian.
03:32:48 Eric Warmenhoven: holy crap
03:33:00 RobFlynn: Sesquipedalians such as idiosyncracy are often times
considered ambiguous.  Why use a large word when a dimunitve one will suffice?
