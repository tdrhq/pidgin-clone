Most of this code is either based off of or taken from:
libfaim by Adam Fritzler, et al., http://sourceforge.net/projects/libfaim/
icqlib by Bill Soudan et al., http://sourceforge.net/projects/icqlib/
libyahoo by Nathan Neulinger et al., http://sourceforge.net/projects/libyahoo/

I did not reverse engineer the protocol at all. All of that work was done by
everyone who has worked on libyahoo.
