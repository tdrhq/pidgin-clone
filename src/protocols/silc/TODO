Features TODO (maybe)
=====================

Sending images
	- PROTO_IM_IMAGES flag support.  We need easy way to map the
	  image filenames to their MIME types to do this.
	- Sending images to channel too, if Gaim allows it.

Preferences
	- Add joined channels to buddy list automatically (during
	  session)
	- Add joined channels to buddy list automatically permanently
