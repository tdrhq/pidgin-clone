aim.h
-----
  - Needs a bit of cleaning

info.c
------
  - aim_userinfo_s isn't real good. There is no way to tell the client
      which fields are present and which are zero because they weren't
      provided.

search.c
------------
  - Still need aim_usersearch_name()

snac.c
----------
  - Should implement better SNAC handling

rxhandlers.c
----------------
  - Need a better solution than sleep()
