* Decide how to handle QQ status icons, which are customizable and legion.
* Give "Online Offline" and "My Offline" statuses appropriate titles.
* Handle emoticon at beginning of message via passthrough_unknown_commands.
* Fix file transfer.
* QQ protocol currently breaks Chinese localization of Gaim. Fix this.
* Fix ability to insert images into a conversation via the menubar.
* Fix _qq_menu_block_buddy in qq.c
* Eliminate all references to QQWry.dat and the geolocation lookup feature previously present OpenQ.
* Give smileys verbal instead of numerical titles.
* Clean up signedness warnings.

* Better decomposition: 
** some of these functions are _really_ long

** eliminate group_misc.c
** investigate whether all of these externs are appropriate
* Check for memory leaks.
