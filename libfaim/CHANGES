No release numbers
------------------
 - Sun Apr  2 07:29:11 UTC 2000
   - Redid much of the tx path to remove the superfluous copy.  But
       it touches every function that transmits.  Its been a long 
       time in coming.
   - Added caps parameter to aim_bos_setprofile().  You can now
       control what capabilties you show up as others to
   - Added ->capabilities to userinfo.  It should be nonzero when
       its coming off buddy oncoming information, but NOT requested
       user info.

 - Sun Apr  2 01:45:15 UTC 2000
   - Increased AIM_CONN_MAX from 5 to 7.  Precausionary only
   - Removed deprecated TIS_TELNET_PROXY from faim/faimconfig.h
   - Added macros for the simple integer functions in aim_util.c
   - Removed usage of aim_failsaferead() 
      - Still not sure why I had it to begin with.  I think it 
        was a remament from when we used non-blocking sockets
        (which I don't know why I did either)
   - Removed some of the oddities in aim_get_command()
      - gprof showed this taking 20kns on my k6-300.  Should be faster now.
      - Added conn parameter.  This should prevent aim_select() from
        getting called too many times in a row.

 - Thu Mar 23 08:45:40 UTC 2000
   - Removed aim_countconn() > 0 check in aim_select(), its logically redundent
   - Added aim_putuserinfo() (inverse of aim_extractuserinfo())
   - Added aim_sendbuddyoncoming/offgoing() 
   - Rearranged loop in rxdispatch()
   - Remove aim_conn_close() if connections dead in aim_get_command()

 - Thu Mar 23 00:44:32 UTC 2000
   - Added a check to purge_rxqueue to skip handled commands

 - Sun Mar 19 06:07:52 UTC 2000
   - Added a parameter to aim_select to return event type 
     - REQUIRES CLIENT CHANGES.
   - For the most part rewrote the tx and rx queuing code 
     - Should fix many, many outstanding problems in and related
         to that code, including one that keeps memory from freeing 
   - Fixed several bugs in various places
   - Reformated a lot of code, and did general cleanups
   - Should have a generally more robust lib now.

   - Fixed bug in aim_snac.c
   - Fixed condition where commands read from connections that have 
       been closed were still left in the queue.  Now cancelled.
   - Added some printfs to aim_info to get more informative crahes
   - Fixed a bug in aim_rxqueue::purge

   - Added awaymsg parameter to bos_setprofile.
     - If awaymsg is nonnull, you will be advertised as being away (your
         class will be ORed with AIM_CLASS_AWAY), otherwise you'll show 
         up normal.

 - Wed Dec 29 10:06:35 UTC 1999

   - Added stubs for the capability TLVs in userinfo.

   - Reimplemented aim_authparse(), aim_handleredirect() using TLVlists
       - The old auth_failed callback is now integrated into the
           success one.  If there was an error, logininfo->errorcode is nonzero

     - Removed all cases where logininfo was passed as vararg to client
   - Fixed small bug in aim_newconn's 'fixing' of host:port addresses
   - Added an install rule to the makefile (installs headers+so only!)
   - Enabled USE_SNAC_FOR_IMS by default, assuming it got fixed
       by n's new aim_snac.c from ages ago

       snacid lookup to get illfated destination SN and pass to client

 - Fri Dec 24 21:30:06 UTC 1999
   - Added an error-counting Read() that has been sitting in my inbox
   - Cleaned up header files, created aim_cbtypes.h.
   - Added void * to aim_conn_t for private client use if they want. (Orb)
   - Removed all stderr output.  All output is important, and goes to stdout.
   - Renamed isautoresponse in IM parser to icbmflags.
   - Added Orb's fix for the new login code, deleted old (see Orb, I do read
       your mail....eventually).
   - Added mailing lists to README.

 - Fri Dec 24 11:12:34 UTC 1999
   - Cleaned up both outgoing and incoming ICBM handling.  Anything
       that crashes around there is no longer libfaims fault!
       - The encoding flags are now passed up to the client.
   - Added several TLV routines to parse large blocks of continuous
       TLV triplets.  Not terribly effecient, but quite elegent in usage.
   - Added icbm_setparams() back in from way-back-long-ago.  It hasn't
       been implemented in a long time, but I think we should still send it.

 - Fri Dec 24 01:23:06 UTC 1999
   - Fixed a very minor bug in aim_newconn().
   - Added aimutil_get{16,32}()
   - Added aim_extractuserinfo() for extracting  user data
       blocks and putting them into struct aim_userinfo_s's.
         - Added a loop to print out info on extraneous TLVs.
         - Put in lots of comments.
   - Added parse_oncoming_middle() to parse the user data
       block of that packet.  Now passes struct aim_userinfo_s
       to client.
   - Rearranged parse_userinfo_middle().  Now passes an entire
       userinfo struct to client instead of individual variables.
   - Convered the version of parse_im_middle() thats actually getting
       used to pass up a userinfo struct.  
   - Updated faimtest to accept new structs.

 - Tue Dec 21 06:18:50 UTC 1999
   - Fixed a Win32 header problem
 - Tue Dec 21 03:44:13 UTC 1999

       of the rate problems that most clients are having.  
   - Renamed lasttx and settxlatency to lastactivity and setlatency, respec.
   - Integrated fixes needed for Win32 -- should compile cleanly now (DMP)
   - Cleaned up some places, use aim_putsnac everywhere now.

 - Sun Sep 26 20:04:20 MST 1999

       - This was needed to work with MacAIM3 and some WinAIM3s.
   - Added aim_conn_settxlatency() for throttling outgoing frames -- NEEDS WORK
   - Added an int to the userinfo and incoming IM user callbacks for new
       TLV that AOL put it in -- its the number of seconds elapsed since
       the user logged in
   - Worked more on the callbacks (more internal rearrangements)
   - Fixed bug in aim_select() (returning negative fds)
   - Clear out logininfo struct before putting more data into it

       aim_send_im_away()
