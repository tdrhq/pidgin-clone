-=[ GAIM ]=-  The Pimpin' Penguin AIM Clone That's Good For The Soul!

0.11.0-pre10 (04/13/2001):
	Rob: EEP! It's Friday the 13th!!!  I think I fixed a few buggies
	in MSN and then added some new features to IRC.  I have a headache
	right now, though, so I won't talk much.  I think I'm going to go
	to sleep.  Next release, I should have a good bit more done on
	IRC and will have made Napster more stable.  Have fun!!



0.11.0-pre9 (03/26/2001):
	Rob: Well, looks AOL was doing something naughty earlier this
	morning.  Thanks to a very nice guy named Adam Fritzler (you
	all know him from libfaim) we're now back online.  Thanks,
	Adam.  I'll buy you a drink sometime :-).  

0.11.0-pre8 (03/23/2001):
	Eric: Oo wow :) So I guess the big news is that this release should
	help you avoid the battle between Jabber and AOL. Most protocols
	got a few good bugfixes; thanks to people who pointed them out :).
	Hopefully for the next release I'll make it so you can register a
	jabber.org account, and then you can support Jabber using Gaim.
	I think (I *think*) Oscar blocking is working now. Haha, get it?
	Oscar blocking? It took me a while to get it, too. But no, really,
	I think that the permit/deny list in Oscar might be working.

	Rob: MSN got some fixes and should be really stable now.  It had 
	a little 100% CPU eating bug but that's taken care of now.  Next
	on my list of repairs is the napster plugin.  It works -- sorta --
	sometimes.  Heh.   As all of you probably know already, our Oscar
	support was broken yesterday.  There's a little battle going on
	between AOL and Jabber and we caught a bullet during the crossfire.
	I think I just won the award for the most cliches used in one
	paragraph, as a matter of fact. ;-). 

	** Good luck to the Jabber guys in getting this resolved **


0.11.0-pre7 (03/16/2001):
	Rob: Hey! I finally rewrote the MSN plugin.  Sorry, I'm just 
	a lazy code whore sometimes, heheh.  It pretty much has the same
	functionality as before with the exception of instability.  I
	didn't really like that feature very much so I removed it.  I hope
	you guys don't mind too terribly much ;-). 

	Eric: In this week's installment of gaim you'll find a new Yahoo!
	library and an option to have all conversations in one window,
	in addition to numerous bug fixes and other improvements. Don't
	forget to send us your feedback. If there's something you want
	added, changed, or fixed, head over to our SourceForge page at
	http://sourceforge.net/projects/gaim/ and tells us about it.


0.11.0-pre6 (03/06/2001):
	Eric: Yay! I get to go first!

	The biggest change in this release is the TODO file. Lots of things
	got added. There's going to be a lot of prereleases. Please help.
	Other than that it's mostly just a lot of bugfixes. Oscar got a few
	new features. Head on over to http://sourceforge.net/projects/gaim
	and tell us what you'd like to see in gaim. We've gotten a lot of
	great requests so far, thanks.

	I think I like releasing every week.

	Rob: I've been bad so Eric got to go first.  The biggest change
	In this release is the NEWS file.  It's the only thing I contributed
	to!  heh, just kidding.  This is a bug fix release, as Eric said.
	Next release will contain my newly rewritten MSN plugin.  You guys
	should be happy with it :).  

	Oh yeah, TUCAN rocks :)  Oh yeah, Eric rocks too. 


0.11.0-pre5 (02/26/2001):
	Rob: Yeah, I promise this is the last pre-release :-D.  That seems
	to be a pretty common saying around here, huh?  Well, I must first
	appologize.  The protocols that I was working on really should be
	much more developed at this point -- they should be completed,
	actually.  Unfortunately, my real life job (yes, I have one hehe) got
	a little too busy and ate up all of my free time.  I promise that
	things will get better now :).  

	Eric: I don't promise that this is the last pre-release. :) But
	hopefully releases can start coming more often than once every two
	months. I don't really have much else to say. It's been a slow
	couple of months.

	Rob: I promise to hack gaim again.  Please don't hate me.

0.11.0-pre4:
	Rob: HOORAY FOR DISNEYLAND!

	Eric: One more prerelease. I'm actually starting to think these
	prereleases are a good idea; a lot of people reported a lot of
	bugs in pre3 and most of them are fixed now. Also, it helps with
	the whole release early-release often philosophy.

	The big news in this prerelease is two more protocols: Jabber and
	Napster. Both of them don't have any of the features that make
	these services cool, yet. You can't use the transports in Jabber
	and you can't download file in Napster. But you will be able to,
	soon :)

	Rob and I are going on vacation starting today until after New
	Year's, which is a lot of the reason we wanted to get this release
	out; it's much improved over pre3. Happy Holidays everyone.

0.11.0-pre3 (12/15/2000):
	Rob: Well, I hadn't initially planned on an 0.11.0pre3 but it 
	looks like it was needed.  That's not necessarially a bad thing,
	mind you.  It just means you get to see more goodies!  
	
	This release includes some other fun features.  See the ChangeLog
	for more information.  Also found in this wonderful release is
	an MSN plugin.  For all of you who have been holding onto Windows
	simply because you have friends on MSN Messenger that you don't want
	to leave, this plugin is for you! :) 

	Guys, make sure you send us bug reports; preferably on the 
	SourceForge bug report forum at 
	http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/gaim/.  This will allow both
	Eric and I to handle the bugs and will prevent either one of us
	from losing the bug reports that are sent via AIM :-)

	Eric: Hey everybody, Rob and I really want to hear what you guys want
	to see in gaim. Head over to http://sourceforge.net/projects/gaim and
	leave a message in the Open Discussion forum. We've gotten a lot of
	good ideas so far (most of them didn't make it into this release,
	unfortunately).

	If any of you want to test out your mad coding skills, I can think of
	a few projects that would be incredibly useful. Send me or Rob an IM
	and we'll let you know how you can help. And don't forget to read the
	HACKING file to see how gaim's put together.

	This is hopefully going to be the last prerelease; now that all the
	protocols that we're going to be doing for 0.11.0 are available it's
	mostly just going to be hacking on them and getting them in usable
	condition before the final release. Don't forget to send us bug
	reports ;)

0.11.0-pre2 (12/04/2000):
	Rob: I messed up.  Oh well, it's fixed.

0.11.0-pre1 (12/03/2000):
	Rob: Hey guys!  Guess what!?  Yup, you're correct!  It's the pre1 
	release  of 0.11.0. We have all sorts of goodies in this release!  
	Check out the  ChangeLog file.  As always if you find any bugs, 
	please report them on www.sourceforge.net/projects/gaim/
	
	You may find several small bugs as this is still a prerelease.  

	You may want to note that my IRC plugin does not have full 
	functionality as of yet.  All of the important / commands will be 
	added before the final release. Also, if someone could send me 
	some good buddylist pixmaps for the irc plugin then I'd much 
	appreciate it.  Thanks to everyone who made this new release possible!

	If you have any ideas, comments, or suggestions, please let us know 
	either by e-mail or via the source forge message board at the URL 
	above. :)


	Eric: So what was Yay! For Gaim!? Yay was the codename for the 
	Yahoo plugin. The whole point of all of these changes was I wanted to 
	make a proof-of-concept plugin that would let Gaim sign into Yahoo. It 
	turned out to be pretty much impossible with the old code. So,
	Rob and I hacked gaim so we could do just that. There's now a whole new 
	class of plugins, Protocol Plugins, that let users dynamically add new 
	protocols to Gaim. Just load the plugin, and create a new account that 
	uses that protocol, and you're set! Yay! (Oscar and TOC are both still 
	static. Gaim is, after all, primarily an AIM client.)

	Lots of people have been very generous and contributed a lot of 
	time and  effort to writing some really nice patches for gaim since 
	the last release. To all of you, a big thanks.

0.10.3 (10/09/2000):
	Rob: I am dumb.
	Eric: I am not dumb.
	
0.10.2 (10/07/2000):
	Rob: What do you want me to say for yours?
	Eric: What happened since the last release?
	Rob: You got DSL.
	Eric: Oh yeah, I'm more available now.
	Rob: On a more serious note, this is just a quick release
	to hold everyone over.  Look for some very awesome things
	coming in the next version.  I can't say what, just yet,
	but what I can say is, Yay! For Gaim!

0.10.1 (09/15/2000):

	Rob: Hi Hi Hi!  Yet another gaim release pushed out the door
	for you guys.  I hope you all enjoy it.  There was a few minor
	issues cleared up in this version as well as the repair of
	OSCAR support.  Hopefully we won't run into the same problem
	as before.  Oh well ;-).  There's also a few small extra goodies
	in here for you guys just check out the Change Log.  I hope you all
	enjoy and take care! 

	Eric: Wanna know what the Oscar problem was? You'll laugh. 2 bytes.
	The fix was changing 0x07da to 0x0686. Anyway, aside from the fix
	for that, there are a couple other good things. Beware of DSL nazis.
	They won't give you service until 6 weeks after you order it. So um,
	yeah.

0.10.0 (09/11/2000):
	Rob: Well peoples, I know that it's been a while since our
	last release.  Here we go.  Some brand spankin' new interfaces
	for you guys to oogle at.  I hope you all enjoy it.  Hopefully
	our next release won't take as long to finish up.  Real life
	kind of crept up on Eric and I and took up a lot of our times.
	Life sucks that way sometimes.  Anyways, we're back and all
	is well.  Thanks for hanging in there guys and we hope
	you enjoy it! 

	Eric: LWE was so cool. Rob and I met up there, we had a blast. But I
	only got to go for one day and Rob got to go for three. Lucky bastard.
	It's been so long since the last release that I don't even remember
	what's changed. But all of it is good :) Like Rob said, all kinds of
	new UI stuff. I think there are some new features in there too. Now
	I'm headed back to school so I'll have more time to hack gaim (isn't
	that supposed to be the reverse?), just as soon as I get my internet
	connection back >:-/ .

	Rob: Oh yeah, some of our pixmaps may need a little work.  We took
	a lot of them from the Gnome Stock icons.  If anyone could do some
	custom ones that stay within the 24x24 boundary and keep the same
	idea and feel as the gnome icons then we would be more than happy
	to use them.  Thanks much!! Viva la LWE.
 

0.9.20 (07/14/2000):
	Rob: Well, guys, I hope you enjoy this version.  I've done quite a bit
	of work to the user interface.  It's still not in the state that I
	would like it to be, though.  Over the next few versions you will
	notice a few more interface changes as we try to bring a more
	professional look to GAIM.  As always, we will stay true to our
	pimpin' penguin atittude. 

	Eric: While Rob's been busy making things pretty, I've been busy
	making things work :). The chat and IM windows got merged, which
	means that they both have the same features (notably, IM has /me
	and chat has font/color dialogs and smileys). Also smileys should
	work better in general now (thanks fflew).
	
	Rob: By the way, what Eric is saying is that he's smart and I'm
	not and that he does all of the work and I sit on my butt all
	day and claim to do work.  WOOO!  Just kidding, brother :-P


0.9.19 (06/09/2000):
	Rob: PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA 
	PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA 
	PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA PLA  

	All of that nonsense aside, there are a few things that DIDN'T happen
	in this version of gaim.  The user interface changes will wait until
	the 0.9.20 release.  We've decided to turn 0.9.19 into a "new feature
	and major bug fix" release.  All/Most major bugs should be worked out
	now.  We're sorry about the problem of segfaulting when your buddylist
	stored on the server was null.  Oops! We won't let it happen again,
	we promise.

	Eric: Lots of good changes in this one, including locale support. Chat
	had a lot of things done to it, but it's still not finished. The UI
	didn't get the overhaul we were planning, but we wanted to get a few
	bugfixes out.

	Lemme say something about reporting bugs. Please do. Please try to give
	as much information as you can. But regardless of how much information
	you give, please be POLITE. If you tell us our software is crap then
	we're probably not going to respond well.
	
	Rob: Before I close up and say goodnight, I'd like to say that I 
	agree with Eric.  Reporting problems and/or helpful criticism in
	a polite manner always yields the best results.  Peace all, and 
	happy hacking.

0.9.18 (06/02/2000):
	Rob: Talk about release early, release often - sheesh!  We're going
	insane.  Ya know, I'm not too happy with the GAIM UI.  I dont know
	how the rest of you feel but it's time for a nice overhaul.  In the
	next few days I'll be sitting down with some of my friends and coming
	up with an improved interface.  I hope you all enjoy it.  It'll
	include better looking dialogs, icons, sounds (hopefully lol), etc.

	And -- for your random silly message of the day --

	"Beans and Franks, Beans and Franks, Wine And Beer, Have No Fear!
	I can sing! I can dance! I have a penguin in my pants!"

			- Rob Flynn after not having enough sleep.

	Eric: I've had less sleep than Rob, I can guarantee you that. There's
	actually a lot going on in this release, despite 2 releases 2 days ago.
	Don't ask me how; I think the elves had something to do with it.

	Oscar support is almost to the point where I'm considering removing
	the 'experimental' label from configure. For those of you brave enough
	to try it, I'd like feedback. (And if you happen to write a patch to
	fix some of the stuff that would be really cool too.) Hopefully for the
	next release, in addition to the cool new UI, Gaim/Faim will be able to
	do nearly everything Gaim/TOC can do. (Big things coming in 0.9.19, I
	can feel it....)

	And just remember, you *can* have too many gummi candies. Especially if
	you eat nearly a whole kilo of them. Believe me. I know. But the gummi
	cherries are damn good.

0.9.17 (05/31/2000):
	Rob: I am an e-mail fiend!
	(after receiving 60 emails within a 5 minute period about a problem
	and responding to all of them immediately)

	I am stupid.

	Eric: Heh heh. 2 releases in one day. I'm impressed. Maybe one of these
times we'll actually get some of it right ;) Anyway, yeah. Just bug fixes in
this one.

	Rob: Yeah, we wouldn't be ourselves if we released it once and got it right, would we? :-)

0.9.16;
	Rob: Blah Blah Blah.

	Eric: Looks like Rob didn't have much to say, so I'll write something
instead :)

	There's a few good things in this release, the most important of them
being: Better proxy support, of course. Oh yeah, and you can sign on now,
so that's a good thing too. There's a few more good things going on in this
release, so check out the ChangeLog. 

	Play nicely, and we'll keep hacking away at it.

	Rob: Go Watch `Road Trip'. 

0.9.15:
	Hey boy's and girls.  There's not much to say here this time.
We're loving Southern California, the new job's going great.  We just
got our company website up and the product development is going pretty
smooth.  Life's pretty sweet now.  

	We've hacked up all kinds of goodies for you in 0.9.15.  There's
some file transfer (receive) support for those of you who have been
wanting it for a while. There's some other misc. goodies tossed in as
well.  Enjoy!! Oh yeah, we need a new website.  Come up with a sweet
design and get in touch with me.  The current site is at:
http://www.marko.net/gaim

Thanks much!


0.9.14:
	Well, there's a few random hacks and fixes in here, along with
a little suprise.  You guessed it, kiddos, support for plugins!  Happy
hacking!

0.9.13:
	Not much to say for this release.  Bug fixes, That's all.  Look
for the goodies I promised in 0.9.13 to appear in 0.9.14 which should be
released very soon now.  

	By the way, our CVS is now hosted over at source forge.  Go check
it out at http://www.sourceforge.net.  Please check there before submitting
any bug reports (You can read our CVS comments to see if we have fixed any
problems).

0.9.12:
	Well guys, looks like we got some nifty things in this version.
TrueType Fonts are supported for those XFSTT buffs out there (or whatever
else you use).  A crap load of those plaguing memory leaks have FINALLY been
fixed.  My brother, Jeramey, and a new friend Peter Teichan helped stomp
those babies out.  A rad guy by the name of Eric Warmenhoven has been
really sweet lately and has all but rewritten the Gnome Applet support :).
He submitted patch after patch.  I finally got annoyed with him (just kidding bud)
and gave him CVS access.  Look for Gnome Applet support in Gaim to start improving.
That's about all for now.  I wanted to get this release out there.  File Receive
support will be in 0.9.13 which is due out soon.
	
0.9.11:
	Jeramey got a new Comfy Chair! Its very very comfy!  Whee!
Jim also had a little hyper-drunken moment and started hacking away at
a new configuration format for GAIM.  Looks like we're running .gaimrc
version 1 now.  Gotta love it.  I got bored and hacked in a couple font
properties that will, in time, contain more features.  That's about it
for this version -- cept for that memory leak we fixed.  Shush! We're
not plumbers! -- rob

** Extra special update **

Well guys, it looks like we all stopped working on gaim, moved to California,
and took up a new job.  Don't worry though, those beach bums out here havent
worn off on us yet.  I've decided to pick up the Gaim torch myself and continue
development ont he prohect.  Hopefully we wont have any more five month braks in
the project.  Sorry about that, guys :)

0.9.10: 
	Umm.  Dont ask.  Silly memory leak.  For those of you who
wondered, you were losing about 256 bytes every 25 seconds for each
person you have on your contact list.  Make fun of us.  Better yet ..
Send us beer.  We'll do better :)

0.9.9:
	Welp, All of you boys and girls who run Mandrake and have some
problems with GAIM working properly, please check out the FAQ file.  It 
contains a nice fix submitted by one of our users.  I hope this works for
you guys!
	Jim appears to have intoxicated himself.  This is, as always, a
Good Thing (tm).  His late-night adventure with the liquid-bread food group
lead to the birth of a nice little feature called `The Lag-O-Meter'.  Dont
ask, just try it out :).  It is pretty pointless if you have a super-fast
connection but if you are a modem user, like many of us are, then try it out.
	There's also some idle preferences and some other little random
bug fixes.  Check'em out yo :)

0.9.8:
	Get Along Lil' Doggies.  Heh.  Looks like we have yet another new
version of gaim for you guys to play with.  Be gentle now, it has a few
new fetures.  The HTML widget is now more robust and we have *da da da* 
HTTP proxy support.  
	Oh By The Way, Do not pay too much attention to what we are doing
with this release.  We are all a little bit happy tonight.  You must love
life.  This is a special release of gaim.  We will be releasing some wonderful
photographs soon .. or perhaps if we get the bloody webcam working then we
will take a couple of quick snapshots.
	Looks like the GAIM developers convention (cool name huh) that we
had this weekend in Auburn, AL went wonderfully :).  yum yum yum. Hahahah. Oh
by the way.  Beware of insecure rednecks in the deli.  Bad things.
	In (non)related news, Jeramey could not successfully slaughter the
one pound hamburger that he ordered.  (I think he could have done it but he
wasn't feeling very well at the time).
	Oh Yes, New Logo Too :) You likes? Thanks, Naru!
	Just a little side-note: it looks like we didnt make the release that
we had expected during the Gaim Convention.  Maybe we partied too much? I am
not sure.  I remember watching the sun rise before I went to bed, though.
Oh well.  Here's your release!  Enjoy!
	By The Way, we have uploaded our party pictures to a website.
http://www.dorky.net/gaim/party/  They are nothing spectacular but I hope you
enjoy them! :).

0.9.7:
	Well, boys and girls, it's that time again!  Yup, time for the good
release fairy to come bless us with her infinite wisdom and divine presence.
Umm, yeah, something like that.  Anyways, this release has several little
"bad" network fixes (as Jim likes to say) and a couple touch-ups to a few
other features.  It also features preliminary oscar support.  Thanks to Jim
and Adam ("the libfaim guy")  hehe :)  We have also corrected a problem with
gaim not wainting to correctly save your password if you have an underscore
in it.  Thanks to w1za7d for pointing out the underscore problem.  ' and \
have also been fixed in passwords. :o) 

0.9.6:
	Sorry about the little segfaulting bugs in the past release.  Rob
is stupid. :).  Anyways, they have been patched up and a couple new features
have been added.  I hope you guys enjoy.

0.9.5:
	Well we added a myriad of new features to this release. (A lot of
small buggie fixes too.)  If you need a detailed list just check out the
ChangeLog.  We now have a new webpage design and have added a FAQ to the
distribution.  Before coming to us with any problems please take a quick
look through the FAQ to make sure we havent already covered your question.
	Also, thanks to our beloved Web Monkey, FlynOrange, we have all
learned the true power of foam weapons, slinkies, and whoopie cushions.  Hmm
gotta love those pranks, eh?

0.8.0:
	Well, just starting the NEWS file.  I'll try to remember what's new
from the last version.  Hmmm.  BIG code reorg.  Import/export, buddy pounce
among the major new features.  Autoconf script too, which is a big win.
Apologies to those who submitted patches which haven't made it in.. I
promise, the next version!  This code reorg took up a lot of my time, and I
want to get it out there.
