version 0.9.20:
	It's 3 am the night before finals, it's obviously a good time to hack
	gaim.

	The first thing to note is that there are about 9 new events plugins
	can attach to, most of them dealing with chat, since I know that was a
	big thing that was missing. Please note that I was nice and decided to
	tack these extra events onto the end of the enum, which means that
	plugins do not have to be recompiled in order for them to still work.

	The big thing to note is that gaim_plugin_init no longer returns void,
	but int.  If it returns 0, gaim interprets this as there being no
	error, and continues with loading as normal. (This should be backwards-
	compatible: returning 0 is the equivalent of returning void.) If it
	returns a non-zero number, there was an error loading detected by the
	plugin. At that point, gaim will try to clean things up by removing any
	callbacks that have been added by the plugin. It will then try to call
	the plugin's gaim_plugin_error function, if there is one. The function
	should take an int (the int returned by gaim_plugin_init) and return a
	char*. If the char* is not NULL, it is displayed by gaim as an error
	message.  The plugin is then unloaded and closed and life goes back to
	normal. If any of that was confusing, it was confusing to me, too. I
	added a plugin, error.c, which should help clear things up.
