enum gaim_event {
	event_signon = 0,
	event_signoff,
	event_im_recv,
	event_im_send,
	event_buddy_signon,
	event_buddy_signoff,
};

To add a signal handler, call the fuction gaim_signal_connect with the
following arguments:

enum gaim_event, void *, void *

The first arg is hopefully obvious.
The second arg is a pointer to a function that takes various args
	depending on which event you're dealing with.
The third arg is any data you want to send to your function, as a final
	argument.

So here are the args that get passed to your functions in various events:

event_signon:
	char *name

	'name' is your username. (Note that this can be returned through
		other methods.)

event_signoff:
	(none)

event_im_recv:
	char **who, char **text

	'who' is the username of the person who sent the message.
	'text' is the actual strict text (with HTML tags and all) of the
		message they sent.
	
	Note that you can modify these values. (You are encouraged to do so!)

event_im_send:
	char **who, char **text

	'who' is the username of the person you're sending the message to.
	'text' is the actual strict text (with HTML tags and all) of the
		message you're sending.

	Note that you can modify these values. (You are _not_ encouraged to
		do so ;-) .)

event_buddy_signon:
	char *who
	
	'who' is who signed on.

event_buddy_signoff:
	char *who

	'who' is who signed off.
