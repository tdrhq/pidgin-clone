This file is intendended to be a list of source incompatable changes have 
been made since icqlib-1.0.0.

2000-12-19: ICQLINKs have been reworked.  Members that provide no useful 
information to the library client have been moved to a private structure 
attached to the public ICQLINK, ICQLINK_private.  See icqlib.h.  ICQLINK 
memory management now must be performed by the library (which is probably 
how it should have always been), with icq_ICQLINKNew and 
icq_ICQLINKDelete.

2000-12-19: Your application is no longer responsible for allocating and
freeing the ICQLINK structure, rather, it is returned as the result of a
icq_ICQLINKNew call.  icq_ICQLINKDelete will free an ICQLINK structure.

2000-12-19: icq_Init and icq_Done have been removed.  Use icq_ICQLINKNew
and icq_ICQLINKDelete instead.  In addition, icq_ICQLINKNew has gained an
additional parameter: a flag to turn TCP on or off.
