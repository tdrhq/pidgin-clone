DESCRIPTION
-----------
icqlib is the most feature complete, open source, library implementation
of Mirabilis' ICQ protocol available on the Internet. icqlib currently
supports approximately 90% of the ICQ UDP v5 protocol and 80% of the
ICQ TCP v2 protocol, including new UIN registration, chat, and file
transfer.

Features:
* written in C for portability - compiles on most Unices
* supports multiple simultaneous connections to ICQ servers - more
  than one UIN can log in and receive events
* SOCKS5 firewall support for both UDP and TCP protocols
* event driven, non-blocking interface
* supports Russian language - automatically performs conversion from
  Windows 1251 encoding to unix koi8 encoding
