libyahoo 0.17:
	Initial introduction, corresponds to development version
		of gtkyahoo.
	Added some NULL pointer checks to yahoo_array2list and yahoo_cmd_decline_conf
	Added new memtok utility function (see memtok.c) and used it in some of the
		conference packet parsing routines
	Small #include changes for building under Solaris
	Added NOTES file as small beginnings of documentation process
	Cleaned up compiler warnings when building under Solaris
	Started adding support for getting address book entries of Yahoo! buddies
		Currently they're successfully retrieved but not kept anywhere useful
	All addresses can now be retrieved into a context as follows:
		struct yahoo_address   = structure with name, phone numbers...
		context->address_count = number of addresses
		context->addresses     = pointer to first address
		I currently DO NOT call yahoo_fetchaddresses from within yahoo_init, I think it should be optional
		See yahoo_free_addresses for how to iterate over addresses
	Added patch for removebuddy + http proxy support
