Introduction:
-------------
This is GTKYahoo, a GPL'd GTK Yahoo! Pager client. It is functional
enough to carry on normal conversations. New features, and additional
functionality is being added quite frequently.

Please send me patches/fixes/additions/suggestions... Any help is
appreciated.

I _HIGHLY_ suggest reading the ChangeLog and other files in here to get
some details on what is going on with the program, etc.

This software is not supported or sponsored in any way by Yahoo!. 

Where to get:
-------------
Home Page: http://www.unixtools.org/gtkyahoo/

	Root: :pserver:cvs@cvs.unixtools.org:/cvsroot-gtkyahoo

Usage notes:
------------
The first time you run GTKYahoo it will create a configuration directory
and config file. Edit it prior to running the program again.

Look at the sample gtkyahoorc file for info on other options. Note, many
of the features are unimplemented at the moment.

Debugging options are available in the config file, syntax is:
	
	debug "keyword" level

i.e.
	
	debug "yahoolib" 1

Available keywords include: 
	packets: enables tracing of received packets
	yahoolib: enables debugging of yahoolib actions
	sendraw: enables the sendraw facility

Development notes:
------------------
This program makes use of the cfunctions program to build some of it's
header files. This is only done in response to issuing "make proto".
The cfunctions tool is available from the URL:

	http://www.hayamasa.demon.co.uk/cfunctions

The yahoolib files can be pulled out and used to implement the pager
protocol. They are not documented however. The basic functionality of the library is that you give it a pointer to a buffer area, and the size of the buffer, 
and it will return you a raw packet if the buffer contains one. The actual
I/O with the server is up to you.

Other suggested packages include:
	bison, flex, ElectricFence, cvs
