Simple install procedure
========================

  % gzip -cd gtkyahoo-<version>.tar.gz | tar xvf - # unpack the sources
  % cd gtkyahoo-<version>               # change to the toplevel directory
  % ./configure                         # run the `configure' script
  % make                                # build GTKYahoo
  [ Become root if necessary ]
  % make install                        # install GTKYahoo
  % gtkyahoo                            # run gtkyahoo once
  % vi $HOME/.gtkyahoo/gtkyahoorc       # update/create config file

NOTE - OpenBSD (and possibly other *BSD) users might need to use gmake
instead of make when compiling this software.

The Nitty-Gritty
================

The 'configure' script can be given a number of options to enable
and disable various features. For a complete list, type:

  ./configure --help

A few of the more important ones:

*  --prefix=PREFIX         install architecture-independent files in PREFIX
                           [ Defaults to /usr/local ]

Options can be given to the compiler and linker by setting
environment variables before running configure. A few of the more
important ones:

 CC       : The C compiler to use
 CPPFLAGS : Flags for the C preprocesser such as -I and -D
 CFLAGS   : C compiler flags

The most important use of this is to set the
optimization/debugging flags. For instance, to compile with no
debugging information at all, run configure as:

 CFLAGS=-O2 ./configure           # Bourne compatible shells (sh/bash/zsh)

or,

 setenv CFLAGS -O2 ; ./configure  # csh and variants


Installation directories
========================

The location of the installed files is determined by the --prefix
and --exec-prefix options given to configure. There are also more
detailed flags to control individual directories. However, the
use of these flags is not tested.


BSD build instructions
======================

BSD users might need to use gmake instead of make when compiling this
software.


Debian build instructions
=========================

Requires fakeroot and debhelper packages installed.

% fakeroot
% debian/rules binary

This will create a gtkyahoo-<version>.deb file in the higher
directory, not <version> stands for the version number.

[become root]
% dpkg -i gtkyahoo-<version>.deb
