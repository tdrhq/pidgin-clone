Figures out the other person's IP address if they also have the same
plugin loaded.

	This would be a really interesting and pretty useful plugin. It
	could work possibly by sending  'hidden' text in the form of an
	HTML tag or something, and if it receives the same hidden text,
	it could then pass messages back  and forth to send and receive
	the IP addresses.

Perform extra HTML-highlighting and HTML-stripping

	Ever get annoyed because gaim doesn't support some HTML markup?
	Here's a work-around. (Although, if you're this determined, you
	might as well just hack gaim and send us the patches ;-) .)

Auto-reply

	If someone sends you a message, immediately send them a message
	back. Add fun things  to the message. Reverse their  text, then
	send it back to them. Play with fonts and colors and HTML tags.
	Really annoy the hell out of them. :-)

Control gaim by monitoring a file

	I have to admit, I blatently stole  this idea from LICQ. But it
	is a really  interesting concept. What happens is it  watches a
	certain file to see if it's empty or not. If it's not, it reads
	the contents and executes any commands stored in there (such as
	send a message to someone). This  can be nice for having remote
	control of gaim.


These are just some of the ideas I came up with in about ten minutes. A
really nice thing about having plugins  is as long as your code doesn't
segfault, you can keep testing and  debugging without having to restart
gaim. Plus the plugins tend to be small, and quick and easy to compile,
so development should be quick. Try to have FUN with these plugins :-).
(BTW, dibs on the 'control by file' plugin. :-) .)
