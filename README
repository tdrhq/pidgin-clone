Build:

./configure ; make 
for the stock version.  ./configure --help to see what option you can get.
You need to use gmake, BSD make will not work.

You need GTK 1.2.3.  I don't wanna hear about it, if you can't get it to
work under a lower version.

Gaim will try to compile with Gnome features if you have Gnome on your
system. If you don't have them, it will settle for simply GTK. If you
don't want Gnome bits, ./configure --disable-gnome

If you want to build as a GNOME applet:
./configure --enable-panel ; make
then su to root and run "make install". 
Afterwards panel->Add applet->Network->Gaim should be there.

Run:

type "./gaim"

To use the other services (such as Yahoo and IRC) which are available as
plugins:
They are installed in $libdir/gaim, which usually is either /usr/lib/gaim
or /usr/local/lib/gaim, and should have a somewhat descriptive name (e.g.
libyahoo.so or irc.so). Load those plugins using the normal plugin dialog.
Then in the account editor, add a new account; the Protocol option menu
should now have another option for the protocol that you loaded. Then you
can sign that account on.

ICQ and Zephyr are currently the only two protocols that don't use the
global proxy configuration; however, if you have the proxy set to use a
SOCKS5 proxy, ICQ will use it. If the proxy options aren't robust enough
for you there are several libraries that you can link gaim against.

Notes:

This should now compile under Solaris, Digital Unix, Irix, etc w/o a
problem.

This compiles without warnings on Linux-x86 2.2.10 glibc2.1, GTK 1.2.3 system.
If you get warnings on something else, let me know and I'll check it out.
If you get errors, upgrade to the latest GTK-1.2 before bothering me.

The resulting executable is standalone, so you can put it in /usr/bin or
whatever.

The panel (if you made an applet) requires certain things to be in certain
places, but the Makefile/configure script should figure things out for you.

Send me bug reports.  The web page is http://gaim.sourceforge.net/and the ftp
site is ftp://ftp.sourceforge.net/pub/sourceforge/gaim. We also have a
sourceforge page at http://sourceforge.net/projects/gaim/

Keep your eyes out for updates, and I'll try to keep the program maintained.
Other contributors and patches are welcomed.  Please read the FAQ first.
