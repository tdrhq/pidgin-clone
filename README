Build:

./configure ; make 
for the stock version.  ./configure --help to see what option you can get.

You need GTK 1.2.3.  I don't wanna hear about it, if you can't get it to
work under a lower version.

Run:

type "./gaim"

If you want to build as a GNOME applet:
./configure --enable-gnome ; make
then su to root and run "make install". 
Afterwards panel->Add applet->Network->Gaim should be there.

Notes:

This should now compile under Solaris, Digital Unix, Irix, etc w/o a
problem.
This compiles without warnings on Linux-x86 2.2.10 glibc2.1, GTK 1.2.3 system.
If you get warnings on something else, let me know and I'll check it out.
If you get errors, upgrade to the latest GTK-1.2 before bothering me.

The resulting executable is standalone, so you can put it in /usr/bin or
whatever.

The panel (if you made an applet) requires certain things to be in certain
places, but the Makefile/configure script should figure things out for you.
Make sure to enable GNOME sounds if you want gaim sounds for the applet.

Send me bug reports.  The web page is http://www.marko.net/gaim and the ftp
site is ftp://ftp.marko.net/pub/gaim

Keep your eyes out for updates, and I'll try to keep the program maintained.
Other contributors and patches are welcomed.  Please read the FAQ first.
