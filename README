Build:

./configure ; make 
for the stock version.  ./configure --help to see what option you can get.

You need GTK 1.2.3.  I don't wanna hear about it, if you can't get it to
work under a lower version.

Run:

type "./gaim"

If you built as a GNOME applet, su to root and run "make install". 
Afterwards panel->add applet->Amusements->Gaim should be there.

Notes:

This should now compile under Solaris, Digital Unix, Irix, etc w/o a
problem.
This compiles without warnings on Linux-x86 2.2.10 glibc2.1, GTK 1.2.3 system.
If you get warnings on something else, let me know and I'll check it out.
If you get errors, upgrade to the latest GTK-1.2 before bothering me.

The resulting executable is standalone, so you can put it in /usr/bin or
whatever.

Send me bug reports.  The web page is http://www.marko.net/gaim and the ftp
site is ftp://ftp.marko.net/pub/gaim

Keep your eyes out for updates, and I'll try to keep the program maintained.
Other contributors and patches are welcomed.  Please read the FAQ first.
