Gaim allows you to talk to anyone using a variety of messaging 
protocols, including AIM (Oscar and TOC), ICQ, IRC, Yahoo!, 
MSN Messenger, Jabber, Gadu-Gadu, Napster, and Zephyr.  These 
protocols are implemented using a modular, easy to use design.  
To use a protocol, just load the plugin for it.

Gaim supports many common features of other clients, as well as many 
unique features, such as perl scripting and C plugins.

Gaim is NOT affiliated with or endorsed by AOL.
