<h1>Documentation</h1>

<p>
 Please don't contact us about anything but Pidgin problems. Most of us
 are really busy and won't be able to help you. No asking silly questions like
 getting the JDK for Windows (what the...?!?) to work or finding Shockwave
 for Linux or compiling the GTK libs. Don't complain about Pidgin not
 compiling unless you're absolutely POSITIVE that GTK+ 2.0.x (or newer) is
 installed correctly (including the -devel or -dev package!).  And make sure
 you have read through the FAQ!
</p>

<p>
 Lastly, code and documentation patches are welcomed in the <a
 href="http://developer.pidgin.im/search">tracker.</a>  But please,
 please, please, don't submit patches that are in
 a horribly different coding style than what is in Pidgin. In other words,
 noVariablesThatLookLikeThisBecauseRobHatesThem. :)
