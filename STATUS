STATUS of GAIM CVS tree. Last modified $Date: 2000-12-14 13:54:40 -0500 (Thu, 14 Dec 2000) $ by $Author: robflynn $.

This file is meant to provide gaim users who use the CVS version to see whether
they actually want to compile what they just checked out. Gaim CVS is usually
relatively stable (we use it all the time), but has tendencies to be quirky at
times.


OVERALL
=======

The current CVS tree is more or less back to "normal". It seems to be stable,
and allows multiple connections (which should also be stable).

There have been a lot of changes in the past month; I think all of the bugs
have been worked out but I'm sure there are still a lot remaining. Please, if
you get bored one day, go on a big bug hunt.


MULTIPLE CONNECTIONS
====================

I'm impressed that this is working. It took a major restructuring of the
internals of gaim. Everything had been based around one connection, and that
connection used one protocol or the other. Now, there are many connections, and
each connection may be using a different protocol. This change should be nearing
completion now; most things are working and there are very few FIXME's related
to multiple connections left.


BUDDY LIST
==========

The buddy list should now be stable. The only thing that'll be missing is if
you're signed on as more than one name, the tooltips and idle times for buddies
won't display correctly.


Applet
======

The applet should be stable and completely functional now (as far as the applet
part of it goes).


Plugins
=======

The plugin system got a good reworking. It's got a few more features now. Nearly
every plugin is going to need to be rewritten.  Have fun porting from 0.10.x to
0.11.0 (it's actually very simple).


Perl
====

Perl also got a good reworking, but also has a few more features now. Again,
porting from 0.10.x to 0.11.0 should be simple, but read the docs to see what's
going on.


TOC
===

TOC is working reasonably well. The options to use a proxy got moved to the
account editor, and are set up on a per-account basis, in case you were
wondering. TOC can be used to sign into ICQ; though you should use the ICQ
plugin as it offers more functionality.


Oscar
=====

Oscar is working reasonably well. Please see gaim/libfaim/README.gaim for more
details on Oscar. Oscar can be used to sign into ICQ; though you should use the
ICQ plugin as it offers more functionality.


Yahoo
=====

Yahoo currently supports signing on/off, changing status (only to user-defined
so far though), checking other people's status (via right-clicking in the
buddy list), and sending/receiving messages. Chat support is planned but not
yet implemented.


IRC
===

IRC currently supports signing on/off, sending and receiving messages,
joining chat rooms and holding conversations within them.  The buddylist
also works and users have the ability to send ping requests to the user
by right clicking their name.  /me support is also added.  Other commands
and functionality are planned but not yet implemented.


MSN
===

MSN currently supports signing on/off, sending and receiving messages.  The
buddylist is functional. When sending the initial message (to start a
conversation) there will be a small delay.  It will appear as if the
client has frozen.  This will not always be the case.  I have a fix
that I havent taken the time to write yet.


ICQ
===

ICQ currently supports signing on/off, changing status (icq-away == aim-idle,
icq-n/a == aim-away), checking other people's status (but not status message),
sending/receiving messages, and receiving URLs. Keepalives are sent regardless
of whether or not you want them; it's necessary since it's a UDP protocol.
Chat and file transfer are planned but not yet implemented.
