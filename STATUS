STATUS of GAIM CVS tree. Last modified $Date: 2001-02-24 04:34:46 -0500 (Sat, 24 Feb 2001) $ by $Author: warmenhoven $.

This file is meant to provide gaim users who use the CVS version to see whether
they actually want to compile what they just checked out. Gaim CVS is usually
relatively stable (we use it all the time), but has tendencies to be quirky at
times.

Each protocol is hacked by both Rob and Eric, though there is one person that
kind of "owns" a protocol (mostly indicating that they were the person that
originally wrote it). Their name will be next to the protocol; they're the
people to complain to when something doesn't work ;).


OVERALL
=======

The current CVS tree is more or less back to "normal". It seems to be stable,
and allows multiple connections (which should also be stable).

There have been a lot of changes since 0.10.x; I think all of the bugs have
been worked out but I'm sure there are still a lot remaining. Please, if you
get bored one day, go on a big bug hunt.

I broke parallel builds. Sorry. Don't compile plugins if you want a parallel
build. (If someone could tell me how to fix this, and still be somewhat
portable, I'd appreciate it.)


Buddy List
==========

The buddy list should now be stable. The only thing that'll be missing is if
you're signed on as more than one name, the tooltips and idle times for buddies
won't display correctly.


Applet
======

The applet should be stable and completely functional now (as far as the applet
part of it goes).


Plugins
=======

The plugin system got a good reworking. It's got a few more features now. Nearly
every plugin is going to need to be rewritten.  Have fun porting from 0.10.x to
0.11.0 (it's actually very simple).


Perl
====

Perl also got a good reworking, but also has a few more features now. Again,
porting from 0.10.x to 0.11.0 should be simple, but read the docs to see what's
going on.


TOC (Rob)
===

TOC is working reasonably well. The options to use a proxy got moved to the
account editor, and are set up on a per-account basis, in case you were
wondering. TOC can be used to sign into ICQ; though you should use the ICQ
plugin as it offers more functionality.

TOC cannot get people's away messages; TOC also cannot make requests to send
files. It is possible, however, to have an AIM user request to get a file from
or send a file to you. Support for Direct IM, Buddy Icons, and Voice Chat is
being worked on.


Oscar (Eric)
=====

Oscar is working reasonably well. Please see gaim/libfaim/README.gaim for more
details on Oscar. Oscar can be used to sign into ICQ; though you should use the
ICQ plugin as it offers more functionality.

Oscar can get people's away messages, so you should use it if that's what's
important to you. Oscar also supports requesting and accepting Direct IM
connections, but doesn't yet let you send/receive files through this or through
the Get File/Send File method.


Yahoo (Eric)
=====

Yahoo currently supports signing on/off, changing status (only to user-defined
so far though), checking other people's status (via right-clicking in the
buddy list), and sending/receiving messages. You can also select your active ID,
though currently you have to just remember what it is since there's nothing in
the UI that'll let you know. Chat and file transfer are planned but not yet
implemented.


IRC (Rob)
===

IRC currently supports signing on/off, sending and receiving messages,
joining chat rooms and holding conversations within them.  The buddylist
also works and users have the ability to send ping requests to the user
by right clicking their name.  /me support is also added.  Other commands
and functionality are planned but not yet implemented.


MSN (Rob)
===

MSN currently supports signing on/off, sending and receiving messages.  The
buddylist is functional. It also supports permit/deny lists and going
away/idle.

When sending the initial message (to start a conversation) there will be a 
small delay.  It  will appear as if the client has frozen.  This will not 
always be the case.   I have a fix that I havent taken the time to write yet.


ICQ (Eric)
===

ICQ currently supports signing on/off, changing status (icq-away == aim-idle,
icq-n/a == aim-away), checking other people's status (but not status message),
sending/receiving messages, and receiving URLs. Keepalives are sent regardless
of whether or not you want them; it's necessary since it's a UDP protocol.
Chat and file transfer are planned but not yet implemented.


Jabber (Eric)
======

Jabber can sign on/off, send/receive messages, and add/remove buddies. All good
things. If you have a registered transport then you can still use that; however
you won't see it on your buddy list yet; and you can't add or remove transports
yet. Chat is working now.


Napster (Rob)
=======

Heh.  Ok, so I (Rob) am on crack!  Gaim can sign on/off of Napster, add/remove
people to your hotlist (buddylist) as well as chat privately and in chat rooms.
You can search for files and browse a list of other user's files.  You can
currently download files as long as the person you're retrieving files from
is not firewalled.
