STATUS of GAIM CVS tree. Last modified $Date: 2000-10-31 05:49:53 -0500 (Tue, 31 Oct 2000) $ by $Author: warmenhoven $.

This file is meant to provide gaim users who use the CVS version to see whether
they actually want to compile what they just checked out. Gaim CVS is usually
relatively stable (we use it all the time), but has tendencies to be quirky at
times.


OVERALL
=======

The current CVS tree is completely broken. You can still use it to sign in and
converse with users as normal. If you only have one account signed in then all
of the old functions still work perfectly (or as well as they did before The
Change (multiple connections)).

There are a lot of things that are probably going to be very buggy over the
next month or so. Please bear with us.


MULTIPLE CONNECTIONS
====================

I'm impressed that this is working. It took a major restructuring of the
internals of gaim. Everything had been based around one connection, and that
connection used one protocol or the other. Now, there are many connections, and
each connection may be using a different protocol. Most of the functionality is
complete but the UI hasn't been updated to reflect all of the different users.
This change isn't going to be complete for quite some time so just bear with us
as we try to get things operational again.


BUDDY LIST
==========

The buddy list is completely fucked up. It needs to be heavily modified to be
able to support The Change. It is currently in the process of being changed,
and so will probably act very bizarrely. It should still be mostly usable, but
don't try to edit your buddy list.


TOC
===

TOC is working reasonably well.


Oscar
=====

Oscar is working reasonably well. Please see gaim/libfaim/README.gaim for more
details on Oscar.


Applet
======

The applet made a comeback sooner than I expected, mostly because I got chat
working. (This means that I'll be using current CVS as my "permanent" gaim,
and I prefer having gaim as an applet.) Anyway, the UI is still shakey (as is
the rest of gaim) but it is at least functional now.


Plugins
=======

Plugins are more or less done. There may be some back-end reworking, but if you
want to start porting plugins from 0.10 to 0.11 then now's a good time to start
that. I don't think it's going to change much (if at all).


Perl
====

Perl doesn't work at all right now. You can still load and unload perl scripts, but
they won't be able to do very much, unfortunately. I'll get it sorted out as soon as
I figure out how to :-P
