/*
 * This file was auto-generated from the libpurple header files to provide a
 * clean interface between .NET/CLR and the unmanaged C library libpurple.
 *
 * This is the second major commit of the code.
 * Next things:
 *  - A few of the .h files have anonymous parameter names (eg: void cat(int, int).
 *    This program will need to assign these parameters names.
 *  - Function pointers inside structs aren't translated correctly into C#.
 *  - Two places there are specific-length arrays (eg: char hostname[256]). The parser
 *    does not detect them as an array.
