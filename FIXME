GAIM: Items to be fixed
------------------------
make moving buddy list work again (adding/removing works)
not hide empty groups (as an option)
do Buddy Pounces on a per-connection basis
get the permit/deny stuff put back
have per-connection protocol options (e.g. which server to connect to for IRC)
