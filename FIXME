GAIM: Items to be fixed
------------------------
Holy crap.

Take a deep breath.

Holy Crap.

1. We need to modify the login window to allow for multiple connections. (Account Editor needs to be
   a button at the very least.) MOSTLY DONE
2. We need to modify the conversation window to state who you're sending messages as. The current way,
   with the drop-down menu, is pretty crappy, though effective. (Perhaps just repositioning the menu?)
3. We need to modify the buddy list to indicate which buddies belong to which connections. We also
   need to modify the buddy list to vary the right-click menus on a per-conversation basis. (I.e. create
   the menu based on which options the protocol supports.)
4. We need to modify nearly every function in server.c to determine which connection to do things on.
   The ones that still need to be modified have a FIXME comment in them.
   4.1. We need to modify the UI to let the user indicate which account to do things on.
   4.2. We need to decide when people are idle. Right now it's possible to have been idle for 10 minutes
        but only signed on for one. DONE
5. We need to completely modify the plugin/perl system to account for multiple connections.
6. We need to modify functions to account for the possibility of protocol plugins.
7. Get rid of dologin. Signons should be handled differently. The account editor should have final
   control over this. DONE
8. I seriously doubt the applet will compile. If it compiles it definitely won't run.

And that's just the large things. There are countless trivial issues that need to be addressed.
