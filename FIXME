GAIM: Items to be fixed
------------------------
Need to make it so that when the buddy list is edited the main window properly reflects that.
Need to set number of buddies in group (as an option)
Need to not hide empty groups (as an option)
Need to do Buddy Pounces on a per-connection basis
Need to get the permit/deny stuff put back
Need to have per-connection protocol options (e.g. which server to connect to for IRC)
