GAIM: Items to be fixed
------------------------
This is just for the buddy list window now. Everything else is nearing completion.

1. Enforce order. E.g. a buddy list looks like:
	|-Buddies
	|   |--EWarmenhoven
	|   `--RobFlynn
	`-Friends
	    `--Zilding

   Need to enforce that Buddies comes before Friends, and EWarmenhoven comes before RobFlynn.
   See appropriate FIXME comments in buddy.c.

2. Need to make it so that when the buddy list is edited the main window properly reflects that.

3. Need to modify the right-click menu for buddies, to include status for the buddy from each
   connection that has it registered, and also to get available actions from each connection
   that has it registered.

4. Need to get Aliases working again.

5. Need to set number of buddies in group (as an option)

6. Need to not hide empty groups (as an option)
