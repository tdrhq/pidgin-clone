Translation README



Updated: 19-April-2003
------------------

To supply a new translation, you first need a copy of gaim.pot.
This can be built by typing:

./update.pl --pot

from the gaim/po/ directory.

To update an exsting translation, type:

./update.pl LANG

where LANG is the language code to update, such as fr or ja. This will build
a new gaim.pot and update the translation with the changes. You may then
begin editing the updated file.

New or updated translations should be sent to the gaim-devel listserv
(see http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/gaim-devel)

Please check your translations carefully. Make sure you have the same
number of newlines and %s or other formatting codes in the translation as
you have in the original.



Updated: 05-August-2003
------------------

All translations should be in UTF-8.  You can use the following command to 
convert from one encoding to another, if needed:
> iconv -f iso-8859-1 -t utf-8 xx.po > xx.po.new

Before submitting updated or new translations, please run the following 
command to ensure the file does not contain errors:
> msgfmt -c --statistics xx.po

The comments at the top of each .po file should appear as follows:
# Gaim Xxxxx translation
# Copyright (C) 2002, Another Name <email@something.com>
# Copyright (C) 2003, Your Name <email@whatever.com>
#
# This file is distributed under the same license as the Gaim package.

Thank you for flying Valu-Jet.
