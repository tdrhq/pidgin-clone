Translation README

Updated: 19-April-2003
------------------

To supply a new translation, you first need a copy of gaim.pot.
This can be built by typing:

./update.pl --pot

from the gaim/po/ directory.

To update an exsting translation, type:

./update.pl LANG

where LANG is the language code to update, such as fr or ja. This will build
a new gaim.pot and update the translation with the changes. You may then
begin editing the updated file.

New or updated translations should be sent to the gaim-devel listserv
(see http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/gaim-devel)

Please check your translations carefully. Make sure you have the same
number of newlines and %s or other formatting codes in the translation as
you have in the original.
