Translation README

To supply a new translation, you first need a copy of gaim.pot.
This can be built by typing:

intltool-update --pot

from the gaim/po/ directory.

To update an exsting translation, type:

intltool-update -m LANG

where LANG is the language code to update, such as fr or ja.  This will build
a new gaim.pot and update the translation with the changes.  You may then
begin editing the updated file.

Translated .po files may be submitted in whatever native encoding is
most convenient (and hopefully canonical).  Please ensure that the
Content-type: line reflects the proper character set.

New or updated translations should be sent to the translation tracker:
https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=235&atid=713922

Please check your translations carefully.  Make sure you have the same
number of newlines and %s or other formatting codes in the translation as
you have in the original.  The po/check_po.pl script can help with this.

Before submitting updated or new translations, please run the following 
command to ensure the file does not contain errors:
> msgfmt -c --statistics xx.po

The comments at the top of each .po file should appear as follows:
# Gaim Xxxxx translation
# Copyright (C) 2002, Another Name <email@something.com>
# Copyright (C) 2003, Your Name <email@whatever.com>
#
# This file is distributed under the same license as the Gaim package.
