Problem with software firewalls.
.
Well, some upsetting news came up recently. It appears that the default setting for many firewalls in the Linux distros
out there reject incoming UDP messages. This is definately not a good thing being that the discovery methods for
discovering UPnP devices on the local network requires sending out a multicast message over UDP, and listening for
responses from these devices. This means that NAT transparency is not going to work on some Linux distros with
their default setups. The problem doesn't occur in Windows with their default firewall setup.
