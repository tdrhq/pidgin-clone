Final Steps

<p>Just want to give everybody an update on my status with things winding down. I see not many people have
been posting. I assume that is because everyone is scrambling to finish before the 1st. Anyways, UPnP NAT Traversal has been
working for quite some time now. It's been submitted to CVS, and tested successfully on a good number of routers.
At that point it was time to port my code to use all the nice Gaim functions. Things like the glib string functions and the
connection code. I started building NAT traversal as a standalone app to make testing easier. Let me just say that
testing in Gaim has been a pain, requiring everyone to have my compiled version of Gaim and knowing how to run
it from the command line with debugging on. So the initial testing as a standalone app was a huge success, and is
where I found the majority of the problems. Now I have just recently finished porting all my code to use the safer and
friendlier functions, and am ready to commit that to CVS. A couple of bug fixes were found, and fixed, including a bug with PPP
type connections. I hope to hear more success stories as I browse these blogs in the next couple days. Good Luck Everyone.
