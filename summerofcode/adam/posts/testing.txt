Testing the UPnP implementations.

The current status of the NAT traversal library is it is successfully discovering and fetching the external IP address of
the router for Linksys routers. This is great as it is the first of the two things needed for NAT transparency: External IP
address, and port forwarding. I've made my best attempts to get it to work with a DLink router without having one to
run the tests on (thanks to Sean for running my poorly written code). Being there are more routers out there than I
can possibly test my library on, I've decided to write a client logger to help me with the process.

I plan on writing a simple server script in PHP to accept logging information from a client that makes use of the entire
NAT traversal library. I will put logging capabilities around every aspect of the library, including sending the XML description
of the router (something required by all UPnP routers). I will compile this client script and make it available for download. Then
I'm going to ask the help of all willing to run this on their systems so I can gather information on as many routers possible.
This will make testing much easier, and feasible to be done on a large scale before the summer ends.
