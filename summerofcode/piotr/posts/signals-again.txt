Signals reimplemented

A couple of days ago the newest version of DBUS (0.35) came out.  I
upgraded the DBUS library in my system from 0.34 to 0.35 and realized
that propagating gaim signal to DBUS stopped working.  The code
<pre>
  <code>
     #define DBUS_API_SUBJECT_TO_CHANGE
  </code>
</pre>
which you have to put into every <code>*.c</code> file has more
meaning than I thought.  

In version 0.35, the DBUS signal mechanism I relied on was changed, so
that I had to rewrite the gaim signal DBUS-propagation code using the
low-level DBUS GLib API.  This approach should be more robust against
API changes.
