Integrating Gaim and Beagle

I spent most of yesterday installing and playing with beagle, a linux
desktop search engine.  Beagle provides some integration with gaim
out-of-the-box: it indexes gaim logs allows the user to search through
them.  For every match, beagle gives two options: view the log in the
built-in viewer or send start an IM conversation.  The latter option
is implemented using gaim-remote, so it works only for the aim
protocol.

<p>
Since gaim-remote has been rewritten for DBus support, it was quite
easy to modify beagle to offer the "send IM" option for all protocols.
I've also added a "Get Info" action, which asks Gaim to display the
information about the user.
