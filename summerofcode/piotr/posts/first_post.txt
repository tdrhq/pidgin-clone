Gaim takes the dbus

My project for this summer will be to add <code>dbus</code> support to
gaim.  In practical terms, this means that external programs will be
able to communicate with <code>gaim</code> and, for example, change
its status, update the list of buddies, etc.  At the moment, such
communication is possible, however, it uses a custom protocol
implemented by <code>gaim-remote</code>, which is not compatible with
anything else.  On the other hand, <code>dbus</code> is a well-defined
desktop-communication protocol that is becoming the standard.
