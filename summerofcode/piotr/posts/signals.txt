Signals

I've just implemented outgoing DBus signals in gaim.  Basically, you
can inform other applications that somebody has signed in, started a
conversation with you, and similar stuff.

The gaim bindings I use are built around the GObject library.  Gaim
uses its own signal model.  As a result, I had to implement a
converter between these two models.  Now, each signal emitted by gaim
is automatically relayed to DBus.  If you want to see it in action,
run <code>dbus-monitor</code> and launch gaim.

You can use this mechanism to dbusify your gaim signals, but if you're
creating a new type of signal, I'd recommend using native GObject
signals instead.  They are more robust; there are many types which
are not supported by the gaim-dbus converter.

One final remark: the current implementation of GObject DBus doesn't
seem to support signal registration on the fly.  In other words, only
signals registered before starting the main gtk loop seem to work.
I'll look at this problem later.
