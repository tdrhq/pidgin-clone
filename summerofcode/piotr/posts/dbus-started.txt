Preliminary skeleton dbus support in CVS

Yesterday, I've committed the first dbus-aware version of gaim.  It
works with the latest DBUS 0.34 and supports two remote calls "ping"
and "quit".

Still unsure whether dbus should be implemented in gaim proper or as a
plugin.  I welcome comments from anybody who has insights on this issue.
