Greetings Programs!
My name is Andrew Dieffenbach and I'm a junior at Southern Illinois University of 
Edwardsville.<br>
<br>
I'm designing a 'whiteboard' system for Gaim, which will allow people to draw 
and communicate ideas graphically rather than just verbally.  I'm implementing the 
Yahoo Doodle IMVironment service.  If done well, a single interface should provide 
the ability to add other similiar services, such as MSN Whiteboard.<br>
<br>
Until yesterday, I was developing this idea as a plugin.  I was also working against 
v1.3.  I was convinced by my mentor to work against the Head branch.  Also, 
intercepting chat protocol packets from a plugin required a little bit of 
hackery--not too clean and a little greedy, but it was what I <i>had</i> to do.  My 
mentor also convinced me to shift my development from a plugin to working within the 
Yahoo protocol code.  Also, the general whiteboard code will be part of the Gaim 
core.  Because I'm not just developing a plugin anymore, there is a development 
branch dedicated to my project:  gaim-doodle.<br>
<br>
So far, I've established the basic send and recieve packet functions for Yahoo 
Doodle.  This was pretty easy to do after I sniffed the network communication 
between two Yahoo Messenger clients, using Ethereal.  Notes on the packets and other 
observations I've made can be viewed <A HREF =

On an interesting note (which was sort of disturbing for me at the time), on June 
30th, the Yahoo Doodle IMVironment "expired."  No one anywhere could Doodle.  The 
little puffs of smoke my plugin made was about the most active 'Doodling' that the 
Yahoo servers encountered.  Fortunately, I believe on July 2nd, Doodle was back up 
and available.  I compared the Doodle files I had backed up on my Windows partition 
to the 'new' ones.  They were exactly the same.  I never bothered to look for any 
registry variables; at this time, my confidence in my project was revitalized.<br>
