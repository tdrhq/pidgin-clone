Doodle plugin days are over.
Certainly, this opportunity to develope for a professional project like Gaim is 
quite educational.  For instance, when I was first working on my plugin, I was 
slightly concerned about keeping the bulk of my code independent from that of the
user-interface.  The degree of discipline required to maintain 
sufficient distinction between the front-end and back-end code is demanding.<br>

The program is coming along fine.  As implied, I've been working on seperating the 
code.  The three distinct interface layers are as followed:  gtkwhiteboard (ui), 
whiteboard (core), and yahoo_doodle (prpl).<br>

I smell some screenshots coming up on my next blog entry.  Look for those, I 
guess.<br>
