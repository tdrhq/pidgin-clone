Operation!
With the recent addition of the <code>GaimWhiteboardUiOps</code> object, things are 
falling into place and kinda--<i>operating</i>.<br>
<br>
I've set up a basic GUI interface.  Much of what I do tends to have a Doodle bias; it's hard to 
keep from doing such.  Because it's easier to recieve than to give, the local client can now 
interpret and draw what the remote client sends.  Here is a screenshot:<br>

As you can tell, the graphics are not vectored.  Perhaps later, this can be achieved; right now I'm 
using pure GDK.  Despite this difference, I think it translates well.<br>
<br>
The local client can draw as well, but the information is not sent to the remote client.  I'm not 
jumping into this functionality right away, because it's pressing me to think of a generic format 
for the drawing data that isn't so Yahoo Doodle specific.  The 'doodle' posted with this 
entry was drawn entirely by the Yahoo Messenger client.  The local client can only draw in black 
with one brush size, mainly because I haven't the necessary GTK GUI-making skills to quickly 
provide a palette system.<br>
<br>
What I do notice is that the GDK mouse tracking functionality is very sensitive.  Therefore, my 
whiteboard application collects much more deltas or mouse movements, producing at times a pretty 
nervous or jaggy effect.  I've considered a smoothening or averaging effect.  On a similar note, at 
some future point in time, it would be beneficial to create some compression of redundant deltas.  
Of course, this isn't too important at this time.<br>
<br>
I'll be working on the GaimWhiteboard to prpl (namely Yahoo) communication, which I think requires 
a similar sort of UiOp system that was required between GaimWhiteboard and GaimGtkWhiteboard.<br>
