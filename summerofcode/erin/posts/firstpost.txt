Introduction

Hi, this is my first post. I'm a little late since I've been sick the past few days. 

I'm a 26 year old student at James Madison University working on my Master's degree in Information Security.  This summer I will be working to provide more security for Gaim by developing a certificate manager.

That's all for my first post.  I'll talk more about my project tomorrow.
