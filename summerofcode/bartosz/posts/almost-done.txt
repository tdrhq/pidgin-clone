Almost done

I'm getting really close to finish. Most of the features are implemeted:
<ul>
	<li>status and description changes are handled pretty well;</li>
	<li>upload/download of the buddylist to/from the GG servers;</li>
	<li>save/load of the buddylist to/from the file;</li>
	<li>changing password;</li>
	<li>new account registration;</li>
	<li>searching for buddies;</li>
	<li>getting buddy info.</li>
</ul>

To accomplish some of these features I've extended the request API, and
improved notification about the search results. The commits should come really
soon. ;)

From the unfinished work, I have to implement chats and replace libgadu
build-in resolver. Unfortunately, the idea of the chats in Gadu-Gadu is
a complete mistake.
