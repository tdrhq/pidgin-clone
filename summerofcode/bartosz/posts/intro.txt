Introduction

<p>
My name is Bartosz Oler, I'm a 3rd year' MsC Computer Science student at the
Technical University of Szczecin, Poland. This summer I'm working on bringing
Gadu-Gadu Plugin back to life. Gadu-Gadu is a polish IM, a very popular one.
<p>

<p>
I'm quite late with my first blog entry because for the last few weeks I have
been concentrated on going through the basic Gadu-Gadu protocol plugin
implementation.

This summer besides the Summer of Code, I'm serving my apprenticeship which
takes me a lot of time. For the remaining part of day I try to work on my
project. As a result of this, the aforementioned basic implemetation is now
working. :)

<p>
In the nearest future, I'm going to work on the following things:
- add libgadu configuration to the autoconf's setup.
- solve problem of libgadu build-in resolver (probably I'll patch libgadu
  sources to use Gaim's resolver).

When this is be done, I'll merge my code with HEAD. And move on to some more
interesting tasks.

Well, for now that's all the news from the battleground. ;>
