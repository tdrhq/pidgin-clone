Last minute fixings
As the deadline is approaching here is an update of the status of the plugin, some progress have been hindered due to the fact my desktop wasn't functional after moving in to college, nuking the CMOS did the trick. The functional part of the plugin is done such as the UI, file creation/opening/saving, and communication between parties. I still need to finish up the aesthetical features such as color syntaxing, and there are some bugs I need to work on such as finding a way to get around the rate limiting on AIM. So hopefully I'll be able to fix these in time.
