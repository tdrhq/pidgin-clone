Massive code overhaul 
 After being stuck in a little problem all day yesterday and most of today I finally fixed it and in the process did a major code overhaul cleaning it up a little bit. The problem was that I didn't delcare the functions associated with the buttons in my toolbar properly therefore necessary data wasn't passed between functions. Once I fixed that nasty problem everything worked as it was supposed like magic. One other problem I gotta fix is the color syntaxing in the editor. I ran some code in the communication aspect and I don't anticipate any problems in that area. So tomorrow I plan to write some helper functions I am going to be needing, try to get the color stuff working and by sunday get something that works like do basic communicating and finish up in the editor side (find, tab management, etc). Here is a screenshot for now, enjoy. <br> <center><a href="http://gaim.sourceforge.net/summerofcode/cristhian/sshot.jpg"><img src="http://gaim.sourceforge.net/summerofcode/cristhian/sshot.jpg" alt="Screenshot #1" / border="0"/></a></center><br>
