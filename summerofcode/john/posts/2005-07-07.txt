Perl Guts and Blessed Objects
Today was a day of enrichment.  After spending a large amount of time trying to correct the segfaultwhen we try to load the Gaim module into Perl, I felt I needed a foray into the internals of Perl once again to try and better understand the situation.  A few hours was spent with the Perl documentation and source code trying to understand how <code>dXSARGS</code> sets up the stack for the XS code.  In an attempt to always get closer to completing the project, I also finished converting a few more of the API headers into XSUB routines.

I put together some nifty test scripts last night and most things are working well.  Account.xs and BuddyList.xs seem to be working well except for <code>gaim_accounts_connect()</code> which just hangs after creating a <code>GaimConnection</code>, however correcting the problem is a project for another day.  To do some of the XSUBs that I had defered to a later date when I initialally began work on the project, I am going to have to get a better understanding of the Perl API and Perl's internals (lovingly called Perl Guts).  With any luck I will have test scripts for what I have already completed in the next few days.  The variety is a good way to keep the development process interesting since the wrapping of API calls with Perl is not always exciting.

Tomorrow will proably be another day of grep'ing and XSUB writing. I hope to get the bulk of the XSUBs for the current API written in the coming week or two and then test everything I have not already gotten to test along the way.  There are a few lingering API calls that I am going to have to spend some time thinking about how to interface with Perl that I hope to address in the coming day or two.
