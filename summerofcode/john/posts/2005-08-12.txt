Testing and Final Touches
I am finally moved half way across the country to start my graduate studies in a few weeks. However, before the fun of another school year starts, I will be putting the finishing touches on my Summer of Code project.  I have been testing all the components that I can using test scripts.  The scripts  are now committed to CVS so as I do not lose them to a system failure.  I had to come up with a few work arounds for anything that used callback functions.  Some things still do not work the same in perl as they would from a C plugin and I believe I will have to live with it for now.  Plugins can now take advantage of preference tabs, request dialog boxes and most of the other features needed to build some nifty plugins.  Using the gtk2-perl module for Perl allows users to add Gtk GUI elements to their plugins using <code>eval</code> blocks as shown earlier.  I still want to come up with a work around to the namespace problems perl has with other modules so as to remove the need to use <code>eval</code> blocks.  Further work into resolving problems with the perl interpreter crashing Gaim without the use of my added library has thus far been fruitless, but for now the perl interpreter works.  <br><br>
To wrap things up nicely I plan to spend some time testing the rest of the XSubs that are testable, finish up whatever XSubs are still on the TODO list, and with everything in a stable state and most of the API up to date, continue working on the nagging problems that have been correct with hacks, but are in need of more proper solutions.
