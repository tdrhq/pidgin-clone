This is my second post and it is almost the end of the summer :-(
<p>
First of all I would like to say that I am very sorry for posting so little 
during the summer (one post a month, that should be a record). I have been quite 
busy working (yes, I have to eat and buy pretty things) and programming for the SoC, 
and posting was frankly the last thing I was thinking of.

And now, these are the good news. I have commited my first version of the plugin 
that communicates with iChat through Bonjour protocol. I haven't been able to test 
it very hard, so there are probably mountains of bugs, but at least the basic stuff 
(stablishing conversations, sending and receiving messages) seems to work. Everyone 
is invited to test the plugin as thoroughly as possible, reporting all the finded 
bugs to me (I promise that, at least, I will try to fix all of them). I have worked 
with the oldstable branch of the source tree during the summer, but I am going to port it 
to HEAD in the next days.

In order to compile the plugin, you should first install the 1.0.0 version of the Howl library, 
It can be found on <a href="http://www.porchdogsoft.com/products/howl/">Porchdog Software</a>.
Change the file src/protocols/Makefile.am in order to add the bonjour directory to the compilation.
You should also change the configure.ac file to be able to use the plugin and create the Howl 
simbols during compilation. You can use this one (<a href="posts/configure.ac">configure.ac</a>) if 
you don't know how to do it. Then, the normal stuff (autogen.sh, configure, ...).

<b>Things that work:</b>
<br />
<ul>
	<li>Presence of other buddies in the local network using Bonjour protocol.</li>
	<li>Conversations with those buddies.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<b>Things that almost work:</b>
<br />
<ul>
	<li>Changes of status (gaim changes are not seen by the other buddies).</li>
	<li>Font sizes in messages (iChat fonts are correctly translated to Gaim ones, but no viceversa).</li>
</ul>
<br />
<b>Things that are missing:</b>
<br />
<ul>
	<li>Avatars.</li>
	<li>File transfers.</li>
</ul>
