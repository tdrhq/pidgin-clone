<p>
It has been an extended period since my last posting.  As stated in my previous
<br>
entry.  I went home for vacation for two weeks, an environment that was even 
<br>
more difficult to work in than I had anticipated.  During this time period I
<br>
have been looking into how I am planning to capture and output the data from the<br>
webcam.  Initially I headed down the foolish path of trying use the <code>video4linux </code> <br>
from user land.  Not only is it an immensely frustrating task to get the <code> v4l </code> <br>
headers to compile, but as it turns out, and as I should have recognized sooner
<br>
it is completely unnecessary.  <code> Gstreamer </code> provides a <code> v4lsrc </code>  <br>
element that nicely disguises these details.  Thus I am currently in the position <br>
of developing the simple plugin that retrieves the data from the webcam and 
<br>
displays it, while simultaneously looking into building my own Gstreamer element<br>
/plugin that does the image processing on each frame.  I am undeniably behind where 
<br>
I had hoped that I would be at this point, seeing as how I have nothing up and running
<br>
yet.  Getting a grasp of Linux, and then the GObject and GTK frameworks has not been easy.
<br>
Fortunately there is still a month to go with little else marked on my schedule <br>
aside from finding a job and a place to live in the fall (I think that warrants
<br>
a frowny face).  I resolve to keep this blog much more up-to-date in the future.<br>
I have been somewhat embarrassed by my slow progress, but I figure that regular <br>
updates will both demonstrate that I am putting in the effort, as well as motivate
<br>
me to make consistent progress.
