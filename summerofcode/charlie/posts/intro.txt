Introduction July 6th

Hello.

Before I begin the standard prologue of abbreviated geographical location 
<br>
followed quickly by a project description and the ever-elusive plan-of-action,
<br>
I think I should preface this whole endeavor with a sheepish admissiong that 
<br>
this not only marks my first entry for our Summer of Code journal, but also my 
<br>
first blog entry of any kind.  I supposed I'd like to believe that I can 
<br>
attribute this blogging inexperience to a preference for admirable activities 
<br>
like hiking or digesting great literature, but I honestly can't recall doing 
<br>
anything of the sort for the last several years.  I have however, spent a 
<br>
considerable amount of time looking for misplaced wallets and fallen keys.  
<br>
Anyway, enough with the excuses, lets move on to the meat and potatoes.

<p>
Project: Crazy Chat
<p>
Progress to date:  Crazy Chat has gotten off to a characteristically slow start
<br>
, but has some leads as to the whereabouts of its second wind.  Crazy Chat was 
<br>
initially written to run on Apple X11 for a OSX, an uncommon platform for gaim 
<br>
users, so I am moving development to linux (not only to increase the target 
<br>
audience, but also because I believe that development will be easier).  At the 
<br>
time I received the unexpected grant from my archnemesis Google (I'm an Ask 
<br>
Jeeves man, a debate that I will abstain from getting into), I did not have a 
<br>
computer running linux, let alone a laptop running Linux, and I was preparing 
<br>
to return to Baltimore for a two week vacation.  So my first step was to 
<br>
purchase a used Thinkpad, and install Fedora Core 3(convenient for a greenhorn 
<br>
like myself) to make it a dual boot system (leaving Windows XP).  After that I 
<br>
struggled, but ultimately succeeded with the help of my mentor Gary, to compile
<br>
gaim, (a problem that was eventually resolved by re unzipping the tarball, then
<br>
doing the ./configure; make; make install, without the mysterious error).  At 
<br>
this point I experienced the delightful sensation of waking up to a crashed 
<br>
hard drive, which contained, among other things, my personal copy of Crazy 
<br>
Chat.  After trying unsuccessfully to revive the beast, I went out searching 
<br>
for another copy of Crazy Chat, which I believe that I have found on one of the
<br>
Macs in the office of the Stanford Chaparral where we initially were 
<br>
developing.  At this point, progress was put on hold when I packed my bags to 
<br>
go east, spending the first several days of my return in Philadelphia, enjoying
<br>
the Live 8 concert and 4th of July festivities with college friends.  Although 
<br>
the cheese steaks and water ice admittedly did very little to improve Crazy 
<br>
Chat, they were invaluable to morale.  I arrived in Baltimore yesterday, since 
<br>
then I have spent an inordinate amount of time trying to get my wireless card 
<br>
working to settle the conflict between me and my dad over the only ethernet 
<br>
jack, and the rest of the time reading up on various things such as gtk 
<br>
programming in general, autotools, gaim data structures and code, face finding 
<br>
algorithms (a subject I have now put on hold), etc...  Currently I am still 
<br>
fishing around for the specifics of a plan of action.  Clearly I have to:
<br>
1) learn how to capture video for Crazy Chat
<br>
2) learn how to output the graphics (using GtkGlExt i assume)
<br>
3) incorporate the face finding algorithm (I have been looking around at 
<br>
opensource face finders)
<br>
4) learn and implement the networking side of the plugin.
<br>
5) plug in the old graphics code and hopefully write new code.
<p>
Currently I am focusing on this first problem, though it can be difficult not 
<br>
to digress into looking at the other problems from time to time (such as the 
<br>
face finding).  Anyway, that is all for my first blog.
<p>
